It's a very complex topic.\n\n&gt; But I just want to be able to make a 100 pound profit for something I wanted to buy.\n\nI don't see what this has to do with bitcoin.  Can you buy the thing you want with bitcoin, or only with pounds?  If not with bitcoin, then investigating bitcoin probably won't do anything to help you get that thing.\n\n&gt; I\u2019m not a gambler really so this will be a one off.\n\nAhhhh... so you're wanting to exchange some pounds for some bitcoin, wait until the relative exchange rate changes in your favour, then sell those bitcoin for pounds, is that right?\n\nIf so, then let me tell you straight away: There is absolutely *no one* that can tell you what the relative exchange rate of bitcoin to any particular fiat currency is going to do in the short term.  This method of trying to acquire more pounds is *purely* gambling.\n\n&gt; I\u2019ve heard that coinbase is a trustworthy site/app to buy and sell bitcoins.\n\nI've heard the same, but never used them so can't advise you on that.\n\n&gt; But after I receive my bitcoins how do I exchange them into pounds?\n\nThe same way you exchanged pounds for bitcoin.  Most of the large exchanges (I assume Coinbase too) let you \"cash out\" your fiat currency holdings through a transfer to your bank account.\n\n&gt; How do I send and receive?\n\nIf your only intention is to gamble as above, then you don't ever need to send and receive.  You'd transfer pounds to the exchange, exchange those for bitcoin, leave the bitcoin on the exchange until you're ready, exchange the bitcoin for pounds, and then do a bank transfer to get the pounds out.\n\nThere are probably fees involved along the way for some of those steps (notably things like the \"getting pounds out and in to your bank), so you'd want to make sure that you know what those are in advance.\n\n&gt; And most importantly, how can I tell if I\u2019ve made profit before I exchange them into pounds? Because from what I\u2019ve seen a single bitcoin is like 4K pounds, they\u2019re all in decimals now which is a bit confusing.\n\nIf 1 bitcoin is 5000 pounds, you can get 0.1 bitcoin for 500 pounds.  Assuming you do this, then later if 1 bitcoin is worth 6000 pounds, you can get 600 pounds for your 0.1 bitcoin.  There you have your 100 pound profit (again, pay attention to any fees, since you might end up with a bit less after paying to get the pounds out again).\n\nThere are of course no guarantees that bitcoin will soon trade at 6000 pounds though.  It might happen tomorrow, or it might not happen for many many months/years (or technically, it might never happen, but I think that's extremely unlikely).  If the exchange rate were to continue the slide it's been on for the last few months, your value as measured in pounds of that 0.1 bitcoin would also continue decreasing.  If you were to exchange back to pounds at any point during that for whatever reason, you'd therefore have less pounds than you started with.\n\n&gt; What is a trustworthy exchange/conversion site?\n\nI mostly use bitcoin.de because it's quick and easy (tied directly to my bank account, so I don't need to transfer euro in to purchase), but I don't think you can use it outside of Germany.
