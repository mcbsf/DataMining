Heating your house is free.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Heating the whole street is free, and because of the way the laws of nature work, all useful work, be it mining or moving or just thinking, all work produces heat as a by-product, so that&amp;#39;s the default: heat pollution everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cooling on the other hand is impossible, you need to move the heat to somewhere cooler. At some point there is nowhere cooler.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#39;m getting at is there&amp;#39;s an upper limit to the amount of mining that can be done, even if energy is free there are real and practical limits to the amount of energy the human race can use before the oceans boil away, and mining has to be a fraction of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This might seem like far fetched nonsense but the price has gone up by four orders of magnitude, from 60 cents to over 6 grand, in the time I&amp;#39;ve been involved. If it goes up by two more it&amp;#39;s going to cause a global energy crisis and accelerate the destruction of the planet, so we need to look at alternatives to proof of work before it&amp;#39;s too late.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Continued exponential growth hits planet scale pretty fucking quickly, and people are no good at thinking on exponential scales.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "name": "t1_dw62kqm", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Bitcoin/comments/8694dq/bitcoin_and_energy_consumption_rebuttals/dw62kqm/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1521852418.0, "author_flair_text": "redditor for 3 months", "created_utc": 1521823618.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Bitcoin", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 7, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dw5nlwu", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "olenbarus12", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dw5exnc", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Unless we can use the waste heat for something?

More interesting to me is:  even if we all agreed this was a bad thing, what could be done about it?  Nothing.  It is not controlled or controllable.  It&amp;#39;s something that is happening to us.  If you buy in to bitcoin you are buying in to giving away that control (though of course it&amp;#39;s too late even if you don&amp;#39;t buy in to it).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also as the world moves to renewables, as seems to happen (and must happen one day), then the question of the relative proportion of global energy is kind of meaningless - as we make as much as we need.  It&amp;#39;s still important, of course, if significant resources are being devoted to generating that energy, but it&amp;#39;s not like bitcoin is going to deplete the sun.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "name": "t1_dw3gkk5", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Bitcoin/comments/8694dq/bitcoin_and_energy_consumption_rebuttals/dw3gkk5/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1521737261.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1521708461.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Bitcoin", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 10, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_8694dq", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 4, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_8694dq", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 3, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_8694dq", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_8694dq", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dw3wm5l", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AManInBlack2017", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dw3qb14", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Any argument about costs of energy pollution apply equally to all consumers of energy.

It is win/win:  The miners get cheap power (for a limited time) and the community gets the ability to expand infrastructure ahead of demand without leaving expensive equipment idle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can also be a solution in the reverse... imagine a community that permitted the building of a large power generation plant, but the demand never increased.   Now there is a plant capable of producing cheap power, but it is difficult to send that power long distance.  Miners can move in and soak up that excess relatively rapidly, providing the power plant the needed customers to justify their expenses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could see a future in which power producers and miners are very closely related, communicating their plans to each other for mutual benefit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "name": "t1_dw47ims", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Bitcoin/comments/8694dq/bitcoin_and_energy_consumption_rebuttals/dw47ims/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1521770751.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1521741951.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Bitcoin", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dw3y22n", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "bitcoind3", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dw3wizj", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "This is true.
