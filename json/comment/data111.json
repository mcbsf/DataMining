Consider the court records for a child pornography case. I would assume the court keeps at least on copy of the photographs / data in question. We therefore, as a society, already accept that the mere &lt;em&gt;possession&lt;/em&gt; of such information is not in all cases bad. It is a question of intent. We &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt; (the general public) that courts are doing the right thing, and have that &amp;quot;bad data&amp;quot; for the right reasons, so most people have people never even considered the court building as massive repository of terrible, horrible images.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have no intent to interpret strings of data in ways that violate social norms or laws, just relax and don&amp;#39;t give it a second thought. If people accuse you of something, you may have to think about it again for the purposes of explaining to them that you use the blockchain for x, y &amp;amp; z, but not for what they are accusing you of, and you have no idea what they are they are even referring to. You could even ask them how they know the data they are alleging is present is there, like, did they look at some bad pictures to &amp;quot;confirm&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
