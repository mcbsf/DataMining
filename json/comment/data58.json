So what? What issue am I having with my \"centralized\" US dollar? None. Is the fear that the USD will collapse? I don't see that happening in my lifetime....but I have seen bitcoin collapse multiple times.\n\nI think there are a few responses to this. One is that the value of the USD is collapsing gradually over time through inflation (note: many people think a consistent low inflation rate is a good thing for the economy).  For example, since the year 2000, the value of the USD had decreased by about 30%. If we go to 1980, 33 cents would be worth the equivalent of $1 today. If we go back 100 years, 6 cents then is worth the equivalent of $1 today. The USD (and other inflationary currencies) have been collapsing consistently, year over year - it just happens slowly enough that we don't notice it much.\n\nIn trusting a central authority, you are trusting the decisions of the central bank and government now, and indefinitely into the future. Many people don't want to do that. With Bitcoin, the code is open-source, and the amount of currency, how it's added and when is all mathematically laid out. In this sense, there is less trust required for Bitcoin compared to trusting a government.\n\nAnother advantage of a decentralized currency is that most countries stick with their own currency. Adopting the currency of another country would give them a large amount of control over your economy. Bitcoin is not affiliated with any particular country or group, so it may allow people to have a truly global currency, removing the inefficiencies and barriers caused when trading with people from other countries.\n\n&gt;Ok, well I read an article about how bitcoin is taking off in Africa because their local currencies are very unstable and prone to hyper-inflation. This would make sense to me.....again, if bitcoin were stable, but it's not. It's down 22% over the past week. Wouldn't these people have had better luck converting their money into USD or gold?\n\nIt is extremely easy to make money if you have a time machine. You know what works out and what didn't. Bitcoin overall has been increasing in value as the technology improves, as more people become interested and want to try it or use it, and for speculative purposes. If Bitcoin shoots up next week to increase in value 50% does that change how you'd see their decision? \n\nPresumably, Bitcoin's extreme volatility is due to its place in the financial system still being uncertain. It may ultimately prove to be worth nothing (or close to it), though personally I find that unlikely. It may end up to be worth a great deal. The swings in value are in part due to changes in sentiment about the future of Bitcoin, and in part people playing financial games, speculating and trying to guess what other people are going to do. If Bitcoin becomes a major part of the financial system, it would almost certainly have a more stable value.\n\n&gt;That brings me to my next point. Bitcoin is slow. Last week I decided to put my money where my mouth is and (attempt to) make a bitcoin purchase through Newegg. It was honestly kind of a pain in the ass. Once I had the wallet all set up, I went to coinbase to buy my bitcoin. Had to verify identity and bank account, which took a couple days and didn't feel very anonymous. Then I went to buy my bitcoin....oh, it's going to take a week before I can actually access my coins?? That's stupid. Guess what also happened in that week? Bitcoin went from $8700 to $6800. Awesome!\n\n&gt;Then I went to send the money to my wallet. Ok, that also takes forever. While I was waiting for it to confirm, I started reading up on the delays. I saw that during the bitcoin rush, it could take days for transactions to confirm. Also, you can pay a higher fee to have your transaction confirm faster. Ok, that's stupid. Anyway, the whole process of getting set up to buy bitcoin was annoying and drawn out and again, for what benefit? I planned on making a purchase through Newegg. I could have just used my credit card and completed the purchase in seconds. Instead, I waited weeks and ultimately decided to wait in hopes that the value of bitcoin comes back up first. Fun.\n\nThere are many things going on in here. It sounds like you're comparing getting everything set up in Bitcoin to you already having a credit card. You can use local bitcoins rather than a standard exchange if you want them quickly and more anonymously. Or you could sell something for them too.\n\nRight now, minimal transaction fees are going through in the next block, so your transfer taking forever is a little strange. Using Bitcoin at a brick and mortar store and waiting for many confirmations and waiting for hours would certainly be overkill. As you mentioned, lightning is now in beta, and for two people who are using lightning, transactions are nearly instant with negligible fees.\n\nThere was a short span of time when transactions were getting delayed and fees were getting ridiculous. Since that time, exchanges have been batching transactions, and more people have adopted segwit, both of which reduce this problem for increase in transactions in the future. Lightning allows transactions to happen off-chain, helping solve the problem in a different way. Other solutions are still being worked on - people are constantly working to improve how Bitcoin functions.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You might say, &amp;quot;well, it&amp;#39;s decentralized&amp;quot;.

For example, since the year 2000, the value of the USD had decreased by about 30%. If we go to 1980, 33 cents would be worth the equivalent of $1 today. If we go back 100 years, 6 cents then is worth the equivalent of $1 today. The USD (and other inflationary currencies) have been collapsing consistently, year over year - it just happens slowly enough that we don&amp;#39;t notice it much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In trusting a central authority, you are trusting the decisions of the central bank and government now, and indefinitely into the future. Many people don&amp;#39;t want to do that. With Bitcoin, the code is open-source, and the amount of currency, how it&amp;#39;s added and when is all mathematically laid out. In this sense, there is less trust required for Bitcoin compared to trusting a government.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another advantage of a decentralized currency is that most countries stick with their own currency. Adopting the currency of another country would give them a large amount of control over your economy. Bitcoin is not affiliated with any particular country or group, so it may allow people to have a truly global currency, removing the inefficiencies and barriers caused when trading with people from other countries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ok, well I read an article about how bitcoin is taking off in Africa because their local currencies are very unstable and prone to hyper-inflation. This would make sense to me.....again, if bitcoin were stable, but it&amp;#39;s not. It&amp;#39;s down 22% over the past week. Wouldn&amp;#39;t these people have had better luck converting their money into USD or gold?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is extremely easy to make money if you have a time machine. You know what works out and what didn&amp;#39;t. Bitcoin overall has been increasing in value as the technology improves, as more people become interested and want to try it or use it, and for speculative purposes. If Bitcoin shoots up next week to increase in value 50% does that change how you&amp;#39;d see their decision? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Presumably, Bitcoin&amp;#39;s extreme volatility is due to its place in the financial system still being uncertain. It may ultimately prove to be worth nothing (or close to it), though personally I find that unlikely. It may end up to be worth a great deal. The swings in value are in part due to changes in sentiment about the future of Bitcoin, and in part people playing financial games, speculating and trying to guess what other people are going to do. If Bitcoin becomes a major part of the financial system, it would almost certainly have a more stable value.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That brings me to my next point. Bitcoin is slow. Last week I decided to put my money where my mouth is and (attempt to) make a bitcoin purchase through Newegg. It was honestly kind of a pain in the ass. Once I had the wallet all set up, I went to coinbase to buy my bitcoin. Had to verify identity and bank account, which took a couple days and didn&amp;#39;t feel very anonymous. Then I went to buy my bitcoin....oh, it&amp;#39;s going to take a week before I can actually access my coins?? That&amp;#39;s stupid. Guess what also happened in that week? Bitcoin went from $8700 to $6800. Awesome!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I went to send the money to my wallet. Ok, that also takes forever. While I was waiting for it to confirm, I started reading up on the delays. I saw that during the bitcoin rush, it could take days for transactions to confirm. Also, you can pay a higher fee to have your transaction confirm faster. Ok, that&amp;#39;s stupid. Anyway, the whole process of getting set up to buy bitcoin was annoying and drawn out and again, for what benefit? I planned on making a purchase through Newegg. I could have just used my credit card and completed the purchase in seconds. Instead, I waited weeks and ultimately decided to wait in hopes that the value of bitcoin comes back up first. Fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are many things going on in here. It sounds like you&amp;#39;re comparing getting everything set up in Bitcoin to you already having a credit card. You can use local bitcoins rather than a standard exchange if you want them quickly and more anonymously. Or you could sell something for them too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now, minimal transaction fees are going through in the next block, so your transfer taking forever is a little strange. Using Bitcoin at a brick and mortar store and waiting for many confirmations and waiting for hours would certainly be overkill. As you mentioned, lightning is now in beta, and for two people who are using lightning, transactions are nearly instant with negligible fees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a short span of time when transactions were getting delayed and fees were getting ridiculous. Since that time, exchanges have been batching transactions, and more people have adopted segwit, both of which reduce this problem for increase in transactions in the future. Lightning allows transactions to happen off-chain, helping solve the problem in a different way. Other solutions are still being worked on - people are constantly working to improve how Bitcoin functions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "name": "t1_dwj7te4", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Bitcoin/comments/88aqb2/my_opinion_on_bitcoin_its_pointless/dwj7te4/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1522452117.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1522423317.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Bitcoin", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 14, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_88aqb2", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dwj67ng", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "AceHardgroin87", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_88aqb2", "score": 14, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Not sure why you\u2019re being downvoted.

Because they never interact with a BTC/USD exchange, it's irrelevant to them.  Another way to convey this point would be to consider what happens when the USD loses or gains value relative to the Euro - you don't suddenly start seeing rising or falling prices in a USD-based store due to that.  The same would be true in an environment with BTC-based stores.\n\n5) I fully admit that BTC still has a long way to grow before it's \"first-world ready.\" There are a lot of things which still need to be worked on (ease of use being a big one), you need to understand a very important point.  None of those services you are accustomed to are intrinsically part of the USD.  If you live on the East Coast, try buying something from California using only cash (paper money).  You'd have to mail it to them, trust that they received it and were honest about it, etc.  Visa, Venmo, Loans, Credit Card Perks, and all the other stuff that's \"missing from Bitcoin\" are all actually built \"on top of\" the dollar, and are not fundamentally part of the dollar itself.  We're still building these things, but there is nothing about Bitcoin that would prevent them from becoming a reality.\n\n6) Living in the US, you and I are lucky that we have a relatively stable government and economy.  This may not always be true.  Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Greece, and others may seem like \"they'd never happen here\" but if you go back in time a few years, you'd hear the same sentiment in each of those countries.  In fact, every government in the history of mankind has collapsed at some point - so there is no reason to believe that the ones which exist today will exist forever.  This might sound a tad fearmongerish, and to a certain degree it is, but I'm including it just to help illustrate the point.\n\n7) The world is becoming increasingly globalized.  International trade, mobility, and indeed everything is only increasing as time and technology improves.  In that world, it doesn't make sense to have a currency which is only valid in specific regions, or which can be manipulated by a small set of actors.  The world needs a global currency if it wants to transacts globally.  And it wants to transact globally.

The same would be true in an environment with BTC-based stores.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5) I fully admit that BTC still has a long way to grow before it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;first-world ready.&amp;quot; There are a lot of things which still need to be worked on (ease of use being a big one), you need to understand a very important point.  None of those services you are accustomed to are intrinsically part of the USD.  If you live on the East Coast, try buying something from California using only cash (paper money).  You&amp;#39;d have to mail it to them, trust that they received it and were honest about it, etc.  Visa, Venmo, Loans, Credit Card Perks, and all the other stuff that&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;missing from Bitcoin&amp;quot; are all actually built &amp;quot;on top of&amp;quot; the dollar, and are not fundamentally part of the dollar itself.  We&amp;#39;re still building these things, but there is nothing about Bitcoin that would prevent them from becoming a reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6) Living in the US, you and I are lucky that we have a relatively stable government and economy.  This may not always be true.  Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Greece, and others may seem like &amp;quot;they&amp;#39;d never happen here&amp;quot; but if you go back in time a few years, you&amp;#39;d hear the same sentiment in each of those countries.  In fact, every government in the history of mankind has collapsed at some point - so there is no reason to believe that the ones which exist today will exist forever.  This might sound a tad fearmongerish, and to a certain degree it is, but I&amp;#39;m including it just to help illustrate the point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7) The world is becoming increasingly globalized.  International trade, mobility, and indeed everything is only increasing as time and technology improves.  In that world, it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense to have a currency which is only valid in specific regions, or which can be manipulated by a small set of actors.  The world needs a global currency if it wants to transacts globally.  And it wants to transact globally.  It doesn&amp;#39;t make sense for that currency to be backed by a single government, or perhaps even any governmental body at all.  Will that global currency be Bitcoin?  Who knows.  But it&amp;#39;s the best candidate we have right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "name": "t1_dwjaorr", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Bitcoin/comments/88aqb2/my_opinion_on_bitcoin_its_pointless/dwjaorr/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1522454840.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1522426040.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Bitcoin", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 8, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_88aqb2", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_88aqb2", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_88aqb2", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dwkqtob", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "arcrad", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dwkcnnj", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Look at NAT.

Last week I decided to put my money where my mouth is and (attempt to) make a bitcoin purchase through Newegg. It was honestly kind of a pain in the ass. Once I had the wallet all set up, I went to coinbase to buy my bitcoin. Had to verify identity and bank account, which took a couple days and didn't feel very anonymous. Then I went to buy my bitcoin....oh, it's going to take a week before I can actually access my coins?? That's stupid. Guess what also happened in that week? Bitcoin went from $8700 to $6800. Awesome!\n\n&gt;Then I went to send the money to my wallet. Ok, that also takes forever. While I was waiting for it to confirm, I started reading up on the delays. I saw that during the bitcoin rush, it could take days for transactions to confirm. Also, you can pay a higher fee to have your transaction confirm faster. Ok, that's stupid. Anyway, the whole process of getting set up to buy bitcoin was annoying and drawn out and again, for what benefit? I planned on making a purchase through Newegg. I could have just used my credit card and completed the purchase in seconds. Instead, I waited weeks and ultimately decided to wait in hopes that the value of bitcoin comes back up first. Fun.\n\nThats not bitcoins problem though, thats an issue with the exchange. Its also time consuming to open a bank account (maybe not in US, I don't know), but after you opened it its easy to use. My typical bitcoin payment takes around 1 minute (and 10 minutes to verify). You don't need to wait for verification for small goods, when someone sends you btc, you can check your wallet and see the funds instantly, if they have sent it with an acceptable fee its close to impossible to reverse the payment. (again you can wait 10~ minutes if you don't want to bother with it). Lightning network is starting to take off and its going to make payments even faster (close to instant).\n\n\n\nAgain your concerns are not completely baseless, volatility is very problematic, its could never replace fiat for most use cases.

With decentralized systems this scenario can&amp;#39;t happen unless you destroy every access point to that network, or block internet access for the whole country.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "name": "t1_dwjvrec", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Bitcoin/comments/88aqb2/my_opinion_on_bitcoin_its_pointless/dwjvrec/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1522475768.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1522446968.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Bitcoin", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 0, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_88aqb2", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_88aqb2", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_88aqb2", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dwkx4lg", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CadmeusCain", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dwkwady", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Me personally?
