It's the only way to address misguided nonsense.\n\nOK, I'll go into a detailed debunk of your claims, that's to help any noobs who might be confused by your marketbabble. Let's start...\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;A fully-paid up contract to buy a bitcoin at a future date is as good as a bitcoin. The only difference is that it isn't counted in the 21MM cap.\n\n\nThere is no such a thing as a \"full-paid up contract to buy Bitcoin\". At least that's **not** what a futures is. A futures is only an *agreement to buy/sell in the futures, and SETTLE IN THE FUTURE*. You don't settle anything today. A futures is basically a shake of hands that you'll buy/sell in the future. Period. The exchange, on the other hand, requires *some* money down from both so it can settle the contract daily. But that's how the exchange protects *itself*, not you or your counterparty.\n\nAlso, a futures is not the same as a Bitcoin because I can close my position at any time, and the futures is no more. Bitcoin, on the other hand, cannot be \"created and destroyed\" at whim.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;Cash settlement means that futures traders don't have to buy the asset that underlies their contracts, \n\nYes and no. But mostly no. Even with physical settlement there is no need to buy the asset! You open a position, market rallies, you close the position and get cash. You've never seen or dremt about actually taking physical deliver of the underlying.\n\n&gt;so the contract price can differ from the spot price.\n\nFutures and spot price are **tightly constrained** by NO ARBITRAGE arguments, and that's regardless of physical or cash settlement. If one goes up, the other will follow. And the same is true in reverse.\n\n&gt;ETFs have to constantly match their contracts with actual holdings, they aren't allowed to sell 'empty' contracts.\n\n\nAnd yet, there's many more open futures contracts than there are commodities with physical delivery. \n\nPhysical vs cash settlement has got nothing to do with price. Zero. Niet. Nada. Zilch.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;&gt;Selling futures exposes you to the risk bulls will run all over you, and you'll lose your shirt.\n\n&gt;Correct, however if you start slowly and build up volume, then bulls never get a chance because of the poison you're dripping all over them. Ask any gold or silver bug.\n\n\nYou just demonstrated that you have exactly zero real experience in the markets. Or, as Taleb would call it, no \"Skin in the Game\". Which is why this is all marketbabble.\n\nDo you understand that you need cold hard cash for every position you open? And current margin requirements are ~30%, if not more, on CME and CBOE. That means for every Bitcoin futures, you need to put down 30% of the total contract value! So you can slowly build as much volume as you will, you'll need to put up that cash. \n\nAnd \"building volume\" simply means that you are \"selling at the prevailing price\". In other words, you've done your trade, and that's it... you're at the mercy of the market. If the market goes against you, which it easily can without you being able to do anything - remember, you've got only so much margin available to open positions - you get to experience what REKT **really** means.\n\nAlternatively, you can short a bit now, market against you, short some more, market against some more, short some more, .... wash rinse and repeat. But that is again limited by the amount of cash you've got available as margin. And even if you have LOADS of money, you are not playing like a whale anymore, dripping a short here and there. Again, at the mercy of the market.\n\nFinally, even if you put up tons of money, the exchange may simply refuse to let you open as many positions as you wish. Exchanges keep an eye on their customers, and if they see you're doing stupid shit, they'll refuse to open you all that many contracts. You cannot just deposit money in a brokerage account and, say, open 1000 contracts on oil. You just cannot. The people who can do that have been around the corner for ages, and are most definitely not wet behind their ears, unlike a noob. Why would the exchange behave like that? Because you could lose your shirt, and then your conspiratorial noob head would convince itself that it was the exchange's fault and you didn't understand all the risks, blah, blah, blah... and sue them. So they prevent it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;The risk is asymmetric. \n\nTry telling that to a hiring manager on Wall St and see if you get the job. Also demonstrates you don't understand the risks of futures trading... can you see why the exchange will just not let you open all that many positions?\n\n&gt;If bitcoin is $8000 in the market, will I sell more contracts at $7000, or $9000?\n\nYou can sell neither for $7,000 nor for $9,000. Or better, if you attempt to sell at $9,000 you'll get no buyers. At $7,000 people will buy from you as much as they can, and sell their mothers to raise more money to buy from you. Why? Because for every contract you sell at $7,000 they will sell a Bitcoin at $8,000 and get a net, instant and risk-less profit of $1,000. And you'll be on the hook to deliver against your contracts, which will rip your head off. So the exchange won't let you sell any of them.\n\nWhat I described above is an example of arbitrage trade which constrains the forward and spot price significantly. In the real markets, spot and futures will trade very tightly. Always! And regardless of physical vs cash settlement.\n\nArbitrageurs keep the spot and the futures price tight.\n\n&gt;Would you rather wait for a store to have yet another sale, or volunteer to pay over the store price now in case they put their prices up massively in future?\n\nHuh??? That's exactly why a market exists... some people think there's more to gain by waiting, others think there's more to gain by buying now. It's always been like that, in all the markets, and it again has nothing to do with physical vs cash settlement.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7df33e/spot_vs_futures_arbitrage_and_all_that_a_mini/), I wrote this a while ago to clear some confused minds about spot vs futures price. Read it. And then read it again until it sinks in. You'll learn how simple arbitrage trades work as well.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt's not enough to be intelligent to speak intelligently about a topic. It's clear that you have no skin in the game. Take the time to educate yourself, by talking to people who have. And perhaps start playing in the markets, no better education than real life education.\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Somewhat rude.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not rude, but firm.

You&amp;#39;ve never seen or dremt about actually taking physical deliver of the underlying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;so the contract price can differ from the spot price.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Futures and spot price are &lt;strong&gt;tightly constrained&lt;/strong&gt; by NO ARBITRAGE arguments, and that&amp;#39;s regardless of physical or cash settlement. If one goes up, the other will follow. And the same is true in reverse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;ETFs have to constantly match their contracts with actual holdings, they aren&amp;#39;t allowed to sell &amp;#39;empty&amp;#39; contracts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yet, there&amp;#39;s many more open futures contracts than there are commodities with physical delivery. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Physical vs cash settlement has got nothing to do with price. Zero. Niet. Nada. Zilch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Selling futures exposes you to the risk bulls will run all over you, and you&amp;#39;ll lose your shirt.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Correct, however if you start slowly and build up volume, then bulls never get a chance because of the poison you&amp;#39;re dripping all over them. Ask any gold or silver bug.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just demonstrated that you have exactly zero real experience in the markets. Or, as Taleb would call it, no &amp;quot;Skin in the Game&amp;quot;. Which is why this is all marketbabble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you understand that you need cold hard cash for every position you open? And current margin requirements are ~30%, if not more, on CME and CBOE. That means for every Bitcoin futures, you need to put down 30% of the total contract value! So you can slowly build as much volume as you will, you&amp;#39;ll need to put up that cash. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And &amp;quot;building volume&amp;quot; simply means that you are &amp;quot;selling at the prevailing price&amp;quot;. In other words, you&amp;#39;ve done your trade, and that&amp;#39;s it... you&amp;#39;re at the mercy of the market. If the market goes against you, which it easily can without you being able to do anything - remember, you&amp;#39;ve got only so much margin available to open positions - you get to experience what REKT &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; means.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can short a bit now, market against you, short some more, market against some more, short some more, .... wash rinse and repeat. But that is again limited by the amount of cash you&amp;#39;ve got available as margin. And even if you have LOADS of money, you are not playing like a whale anymore, dripping a short here and there. Again, at the mercy of the market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, even if you put up tons of money, the exchange may simply refuse to let you open as many positions as you wish. Exchanges keep an eye on their customers, and if they see you&amp;#39;re doing stupid shit, they&amp;#39;ll refuse to open you all that many contracts. You cannot just deposit money in a brokerage account and, say, open 1000 contracts on oil. You just cannot. The people who can do that have been around the corner for ages, and are most definitely not wet behind their ears, unlike a noob. Why would the exchange behave like that? Because you could lose your shirt, and then your conspiratorial noob head would convince itself that it was the exchange&amp;#39;s fault and you didn&amp;#39;t understand all the risks, blah, blah, blah... and sue them. So they prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The risk is asymmetric. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try telling that to a hiring manager on Wall St and see if you get the job. Also demonstrates you don&amp;#39;t understand the risks of futures trading... can you see why the exchange will just not let you open all that many positions?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If bitcoin is $8000 in the market, will I sell more contracts at $7000, or $9000?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can sell neither for $7,000 nor for $9,000. Or better, if you attempt to sell at $9,000 you&amp;#39;ll get no buyers. At $7,000 people will buy from you as much as they can, and sell their mothers to raise more money to buy from you. Why? Because for every contract you sell at $7,000 they will sell a Bitcoin at $8,000 and get a net, instant and risk-less profit of $1,000. And you&amp;#39;ll be on the hook to deliver against your contracts, which will rip your head off. So the exchange won&amp;#39;t let you sell any of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I described above is an example of arbitrage trade which constrains the forward and spot price significantly. In the real markets, spot and futures will trade very tightly. Always! And regardless of physical vs cash settlement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arbitrageurs keep the spot and the futures price tight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Would you rather wait for a store to have yet another sale, or volunteer to pay over the store price now in case they put their prices up massively in future?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Huh??? That&amp;#39;s exactly why a market exists... some people think there&amp;#39;s more to gain by waiting, others think there&amp;#39;s more to gain by buying now. It&amp;#39;s always been like that, in all the markets, and it again has nothing to do with physical vs cash settlement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7df33e/spot_vs_futures_arbitrage_and_all_that_a_mini/\"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;, I wrote this a while ago to clear some confused minds about spot vs futures price.

You&amp;#39;ll learn how simple arbitrage trades work as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not enough to be intelligent to speak intelligently about a topic. It&amp;#39;s clear that you have no skin in the game. Take the time to educate yourself, by talking to people who have.
