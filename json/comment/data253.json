Why would they? Nobody will give you a 1080ti for free. You need to buy these things to mine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;-Is there any negative imapacts to my computer or myself ? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Besides rising electricity bills, no. These bills are payed off long-term via speculation of the price going up from where it&amp;#39;s at now. Various different in-browser calculators that will tell you what you will yield per month in terms of crypto vs. cost you have to pay in electricity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How can i start it ?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buy an Antminer ASIC or a top-end GPU for your computer. One obviously being cheaper than the other. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Is there anything more should i know about it regarding laws etc ?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Depends where you live, but in most cases for the educated world, in terms of laws, no. Nothing to know. Legal in every way possible. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "name": "t1_dwiwizv", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Bitcoin/comments/889gqb/questions_about_starting_for_bitcoin_mining/dwiwizv/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1522437518.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1522408718.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Bitcoin", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}
