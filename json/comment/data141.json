already aware: Roger Ver is a serial liar. A while ago I compiled together a [non-comprehensive list of examples of his lies](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6xpu8j/roger_ver_lies/dmhsmc3/), which included things like claiming to be banned from a subreddit he wasn't actually banned in (and then accidentally posting in it), egregiously misrepresenting his trial (which has a public court transcript available to contrast against), the infamous case where he vouched for Mt.Gox shortly before it imploded, and actions/policies he has taken with regards to the website(s) he controls.\n\n\nIn a classic case of psychological projection, Roger Ver told [a string of lies](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/61r678/rogers_latest_lie_is_out_on_twitter_acuses_aaron/dfhe7r3/) while accusing Aaron van Wirdum of being a liar.\n\n\nAs you can see from the thread above, Roger is often presented information which he deliberately chooses to ignore or suppress. Another excellent example of this is the case where [a single user went out of their way to vandalize a subreddit](https://twitter.com/StopAndDecrypt/status/933174301045469184) (which was repeatedly explained to Roger), and then Roger tried to [misrepresent the episode anyway](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7jax1o/i_roger_ver_will_be_doing_an_ama_on_monday_dec/). Yet another example of this is when Roger [flagrantly misrepresented history](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/825icd/in_2013_everyone_knew_that_bitcoin_could_scale_to/dv96bxf/) and was promptly made aware of how disingenous his depiction was, only to record [a video two days later which repeated (and doubled down on) the very same lie](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/82xdjm/censored_see_the_video_that_core_supporters_had/dvdsjrh/) (as well as making more untruthful statements). Note that Roger conspicuously refuses to respond to or acknowledge the facts of the matter when they are brought to his attention; [here's another example of him doing the same thing after making an unsubstantiated claim](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7zpzh7/what_i_roger_ver_think_about_op_group/duqw6q5/?context=3) (on a related note, if you were wondering what I was referring to in the first paragraph of the previous link, see [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7dlyk4/censorship/duaqgxb/); this well-documented political overmoderation/censorship of rbtc is another subject I've been trying to ask Roger about and only ever get crickets in response).\n\n\nOn a more \"silly\" and \"minor\" note, he likes to make misleading post titles like \"[What I (Roger Ver) think about OP_GROUP](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7zpzh7/what_i_roger_ver_think_about_op_group/)\" without actually saying what he thinks about the proposal (instead engaging in a blatant bait-and-switch where he goes on to make more lies about how their community has \"free and open discussion\" despite the fact that this is false; see the preceding paragraph to get a fuller picture and appreciation of this). On an unrelated-to-crypto note, he has gone out of his way to [defend dogfighting](https://np.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/85ifdc/convicted_dog_fighter_on_f2w/dvyc5sr/), which isn't \"dishonest\" per se, but is reprehensible in another way.\n\n\nHe frequently makes directly-contradictory statements, like when he said [\"I've dumped a few hundred BTC for BCC\" and then two weeks later said \"I haven't cashed a single Bitcoin, or altcoin, or cash, or anything for Bitcoin Cash up until yesterday, and I sold like about a dozen Bitcoins for Bitcoin Cash.\"](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7fmvix/when_you_invite_someone_to_do_a_video_interview/dqdc44h/) Note that even when he makes statements like this (which *cannot* both be true) he will sometimes try to retroactively qualify one or the other in an attempt at further deception; this represents [more lying](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7fmvix/when_you_invite_someone_to_do_a_video_interview/dqdh3ff/). In the same vein, his mining pool [signals support for BIPs that it doesn't enforce](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4zqd7g/roger_ver_does_your_bitcoin_classic_pool_on/).\n\n\nHe repeatedly pushes the false (and destructively misleading) propaganda that \"Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin\" and \"Bitcoin is Bitcoin Cash\"; not only will he resort to [extremely childish images](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7jatfn/conclusion_bitcoin_cash_is_bitcoin/) in the name of this cause (and [repeat the tactic like a broken record](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7w6rnp/reminder_bitcoin_cash_is_effectively_bitcoin/)), but [effectively sponsors it on the bitcoin(dot)com website and the rbtc subreddit (both of which he controls)](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7vw43m/bch_is_apparently_a_scam_according_to_rbitcoin/dtwxbe7/)... to put the icing on the cake, the website was involved in [a \"bitter dispute\" between Ver and OKCoin which resulted from Ver's \"suspicious activity\"](https://bravenewcoin.com/news/roger-ver-revealed-as-bitcoin-com-owner-in-bitter-dispute-with-okcoin/) and [he most likely bought the subreddit in an under-the-table deal in direct violation of reddit's Terms-of-Service](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/84djb8/did_theymos_purchase_rbitcoin_in_2011/dvp8nmi/).\n\n\nThere are other times where his lies and misrepresentations are more subtle. [Take this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8385wt/blockstreams_former_cto_on_bitcoin_cash/), for instance; not only is he purposefully misconstruing a quote (which he apparently doesn't even understand the underlying logic of) and pretending that it is referencing an asset *which didn't even exist at the time*, but in the image/slide Roger created, he includes a screenshot of a **BitPay service fee** as if it is a **Bitcoin network fee** during a time period in which Bitcoin transactions using *1 cent fees* were being processed. It's almost impressive *how much* duplicity Roger was able to cram into a single slide.\n\n\nAnother ridiculous misrepresentation he tried to get away with was the time where he mocked Andreas Antonopoulos on Twitter, and then had the gall to [later claim he \"made Andreas a millionaire\"](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7kf43b/bitcoincom_wallet_2_out_of_5_stars_531_ratings_we/drei7jx/), essentially trying to take personal credit for the donations that the community (and especially @Tether_is_Fiat) provided.\n\n\nHe will [relentlessly promote the known scammer Craig Wright](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7r9ex7/craig_wright_dishes_out_the_truth_on_the_crypto/), promoting links like [this one](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/82axqt/craig_having_shown_me_privately_and_two_of_the/) (where it is claimed that Craig Wright is Satoshi and has possession of Satoshi's private keys) while saying things like [\"In regards to me saying that Craig Wright is Satoshi, uh, **I have never said that publicly**\"](https://youtu.be/E97g-zbR0aU?t=1113). \n\n\nAs part of his propaganda campaign, he'll shamelessly repeat untrue headlines like [\"Bitcoin cash is surging as other cryptocurrencies fall\"](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7y7fgj/bitcoin_cash_is_surging_as_other_cryptocurrencies/) when the reality of the situation is that [most of the time, exchanging your BCH for BTC would have been far more profitable than not doing so](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/823zvv/the_funniest_thing_about_core_trolls_that_i_dont/dv93x53/), and this has proven more and more true as time has gone on (another fact Roger refuses to ever concede).\n\n\nHe will [reference fake projects](https://youtu.be/E97g-zbR0aU?t=831) (which [do not exist, and represent nothing more than misinformation for trolls to parrot](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/848gbk/rbitcoin_on_boycotts/dvohhq3/)) and gets [*extremely* emotional and irrationally upset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCOjCEth6xI) when people use the phrase \"bcash\" to refer to BCH (despite being willing to repeatedly and aggressively misrepresent \"Bitcoin\" as \"Bitcoin Core\", even though the former is a network and asset and the latter is a software client and node implementation). Note that the video link just provided includes Roger Ver \"rage quitting\" from the interview with the quote: \"I've never hired a single sockpuppet\" which [has now been proven to be *another* false statement](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/87t3ot/delicious_proof_that_roger_employs_sockpuppets/).\n\n\nA long time ago, he also [abused his admin rights on blockchain(dot)info to dox (and fully publish) a user's information](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/76u1ft/that_one_time_roger_ver_abused_his_administrator/) over a *$50 dispute* which was the result of *Roger accidentally sending the user BTC* and which had *nothing to do with blockchain(dot)info in the first place*. When the community lambasted him for this (obviously unethical) behavior, he locked and edited the thread to try to cover it up and sweep it under the rug. Fortunately for us (and unfortunately for Roger's reputation), the incident is archived.\n\n\nThis isn't a comprehensive breakdown, either. [Others have compiled](https://decentralize.today/roger-ver-lies-f5333e152858) similar [histories](https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@gank/the-truth-about-roger-ver-and-bch-and-why-you-and-your-usd-should-stay-away) of [Roger Ver lying](https://medium.com/@WhalePanda/roger-ver-from-bitcoin-jesus-to-bitcoin-antichrist-69fc7a17c622), and even *those* don't cover everything.
