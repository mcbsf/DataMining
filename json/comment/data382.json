However, if implemented properly, I think that a tagging system similar to the type that was initially suggested by &lt;a href=\"/u/walloon5\"&gt;u/walloon5&lt;/a&gt; might be a fine solution to making these sorts of discussions easier to start and find, and could perhaps be beneficial to the community as a whole. No doubt, it&amp;#39;s important to recognize that there is a certain amount of overhead when implementing any new change, and this would mean more work for the moderators such as yourself (at least initially), but perhaps a tagging system such as this might make moderating easier in the long run? I don&amp;#39;t know. I&amp;#39;d like your opinion on this if you&amp;#39;re willing to give it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Just saw your reply about the hacked tagging feature. Sorry.
