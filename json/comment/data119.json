Deflation isn't synonymous with appreciation. When fiat currencies become more valuable relative to other fiat currencies, we generally do not refer to that as \"deflation.\" No respectable economist would describe the stock market as \"deflationary\" just because stocks tend on average to increase in value.\n\nBitcoin also isn't deflationary in the sense that its supply is fixed or decreasing. On the contrary, the circulating supply of Bitcoin increases every ten minutes, and will continue to do so for approximately the next 120 years. So I'm not sure why people in the crypto community insist on characterizing Bitcoin as a \"deflationary\" asset.\n\nBut all of that is ultimately beside the point, because \"deflation\" refers to something that can happen to a *currency.* It is completely unrelated to the normal appreciation that is always expected of an *investment.* Furthermore, it's a problem for the economy as a whole, not necessarily for the person who owns the deflating asset. It disincentivizes investment, which leads to the misallocation (i.e. \"hoarding\") of capital.\n\nThe stock market does literally the opposite of that. It's meant to reward people for putting their money to work. Speculating on the future price of a digital asset with no intrinsic value does not count as putting your money to work. It does nothing to strengthen the wider economy. To the extent that it drags down the spending power of people who would otherwise be demanding productive economic activity, it directly *harms* the economy--which is ultimately a bad thing for everyone.\n\nHere's another way of looking at this: even if Bitcoin has been good to you personally, consider the fact that the person who bought your Bitcoin might have otherwise spent that money on shares of stock in a company that actually makes something.

Deflation isn&amp;#39;t synonymous with appreciation. When fiat currencies become more valuable relative to other fiat currencies, we generally do not refer to that as &amp;quot;deflation.&amp;quot; No respectable economist would describe the stock market as &amp;quot;deflationary&amp;quot; just because stocks tend on average to increase in value.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin also isn&amp;#39;t deflationary in the sense that its supply is fixed or decreasing. On the contrary, the circulating supply of Bitcoin increases every ten minutes, and will continue to do so for approximately the next 120 years. So I&amp;#39;m not sure why people in the crypto community insist on characterizing Bitcoin as a &amp;quot;deflationary&amp;quot; asset.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But all of that is ultimately beside the point, because &amp;quot;deflation&amp;quot; refers to something that can happen to a &lt;em&gt;currency.&lt;/em&gt; It is completely unrelated to the normal appreciation that is always expected of an &lt;em&gt;investment.&lt;/em&gt; Furthermore, it&amp;#39;s a problem for the economy as a whole, not necessarily for the person who owns the deflating asset. It disincentivizes investment, which leads to the misallocation (i.e. &amp;quot;hoarding&amp;quot;) of capital.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The stock market does literally the opposite of that. It&amp;#39;s meant to reward people for putting their money to work. Speculating on the future price of a digital asset with no intrinsic value does not count as putting your money to work. It does nothing to strengthen the wider economy. To the extent that it drags down the spending power of people who would otherwise be demanding productive economic activity, it directly &lt;em&gt;harms&lt;/em&gt; the economy--which is ultimately a bad thing for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s another way of looking at this: even if Bitcoin has been good to you personally, consider the fact that the person who bought your Bitcoin might have otherwise spent that money on shares of stock in a company that actually makes something. Is it really better for &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; to have that money, because you bought some Bitcoin when it was cheaper and successfully sat on it for a while?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "name": "t1_dwk8yf7", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Bitcoin/comments/88agbw/deflationary_currencies_beat_inflationary/dwk8yf7/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1522491773.0, "author_flair_text": "redditor for 3 months", "created_utc": 1522462973.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Bitcoin", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dwj5z9n", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "SatoshisDog", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_88agbw", "score": 5, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Very true.

The problem in such a situation is that the economy is losing money and therefore it contracts. But of course a losing and contracting economy is unsustainable. The price rise of the currency is the effect, not the cause. And without exception these events occur with a currency that is monetarily &lt;em&gt;inflating&lt;/em&gt;.
