Their value would still be based on market prices, and people would be free to move them into/out of exchanges or banks to trade/store the tokens (which are now stocks) freely. But this also means that, so long as you and I trust each other, we could trade our assets P2P without need for an exchange or paying any sort of exchange fee. Even better if we can write a smart contract to transact the funds in a way that doesn't require us to trust each other.\n\nThis even opens up the possibility of decentralized exchanges, wherein no central service benefits from the trades because there's no trade fee that's being charged. HOWEVER...this is an interesting problem...if nobody is benefiting from the decentralized exchange of assets, what incentive does anybody have to keep the exchange up and running? Altruism only gets us so far. I point to EtherDelta, an exchange that has been around for a while, but is FAR from user-friendly, even further from being pretty, and only useful for Ethereum-based assets. So decentralized exchanges will suffer from lack of incentive without being able to charge even a small exchange fee. But then, given the right coding and smart contracts, I could see a decentralized exchange that writes into the trading contracts a tiny fee being paid to the exchange's own account; so it acts as a congregation point for interested traders, who benefit from low fees and never having to move their assets out of their control until they are guaranteed to receive assets from a trade.\n\n&gt; It gets especially concerning when you realize that banks have enormous control over the dissemination of information\n\nWhen I said this, I mean banks, with their massive amounts of capital and influence over the media, can control the narrative of decentralized, digital assets (basically controlling the news about them). By releasing misinformation in controlled, focused ways, they can convince the general public of opinions that are not representative of reality. For example, they could try to convince people that leaving tokens on an exchange is every bit as safe as leaving them in a secured wallet. This claim would be easily debunked with fiat paper currencies because they have a physical form, but for cryptocurrencies, if the bank's wallet was prettier/easier to use, then it would disincentive people from pulling their coins off an exchange.\n\nI'm not sure where this thought is going (I'm tired), but I can see a very bleak direction for cryptocurrencies in general if traditional banks control the narrative. That's why I want to make informative videos to help people understand as much as possible.\n\nBanks definitely offer services that are necessities for dealing in fiat currencies in the digital age.

Right now when you \"own\" a stock, it's still just a claim on something that you don't really have ownership over\n\nThat's definitely true, but it's no different than using an exchange. You don't actually have ownership of your coins, just claims to them. Consider why exchanges began: it wasn't because people needed a place to store bitcoins, it was built to facilitate liquidity, because trading bitcoins was extremely difficult. \n\n&gt;It's this shift away from traditional assets to cryptographically secured digital assets that may pose another legitimate threat to banks, beyond the currency argument I've presented.\n\nI just need more convincing on this point I think. The threat to banks has absolutely nothing to do with crypto replacing fiat. The threat, if any, comes from exchanges, which offer no real benefits over a bank, other than early adoption. \n\nLet's say you wanted to buy a stock that was secured a la bitcoin. In order for the stock to be sold to the market, the company in question would have to find out what they were worth in total, and then sell shares of stock on the open market, priced accordingly. \n\nThis is what an investment bank does. They buy ALL the shares of the company in question for a specific price, and then they sell them on the open market for X a share. An IPO. It's important to the company because they get an exact amount of money per share, and they can use financial experts to make sure they are getting what they are worth, and that they are selling at a good price.\n\nSo, if an exchange wanted to take a company public using bitcoin, they'd buy all of the shares with bitcoin, then list all shares at a certain price, in bitcoin, and then people would buy the shares, a la IPO. \n\nNone of these services are different, despite being conducted with bitcoin. Companies still need to know what they are worth, and financial experts are still the best at doing that. \n\n&gt;It gets especially concerning when you realize that banks have enormous control over the dissemination of information\n\nWhile that is true, bitcoin won't solve asymmetric information either. \n\nAsymmetric information isn't knowing what price something was bought at, it's knowing something about a company that the public doesn't know yet. It's actually more often company insiders, rather than banks, and bitcoin won't change this either, because price action won't determine can't determine who knows what any better than fiat can. \n\n&gt;So, in short, it's decentralization that I think empowers cryptocurrencies. Not just when it comes to money, but all sorts of assets. When you and I can trade money, stocks, securities, cars, houses...anything...without the banks dipping their hands in every aspect of our lives because we have no other choices.\n\nI'm not trying to convince people that crypto is useless, quiet the opposite actually. It's just that you and I couldn't use bitcoin to trade anything individually, because without liquidity, we have no measure of what that something is worth. \n\nMy point is that banks don't dip their hands into our affairs because we have no choice, they do so because it's significantly easier for us when they do. They provide a legitimate service, and if they didn't, people wouldn't use it. \n\nDecentralization is protection against government failure. It doesn't change how banks operate in theory, it can only change the medium through which they transact, which in the long run, does nothing to shift the balance of power to the people, and away from banks.

Not just when it comes to money, but all sorts of assets. When you and I can trade money, stocks, securities, cars, houses...anything...without the banks dipping their hands in every aspect of our lives because we have no other choices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not trying to convince people that crypto is useless, quiet the opposite actually. It&amp;#39;s just that you and I couldn&amp;#39;t use bitcoin to trade anything individually, because without liquidity, we have no measure of what that something is worth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My point is that banks don&amp;#39;t dip their hands into our affairs because we have no choice, they do so because it&amp;#39;s significantly easier for us when they do. They provide a legitimate service, and if they didn&amp;#39;t, people wouldn&amp;#39;t use it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Decentralization is protection against government failure. It doesn&amp;#39;t change how banks operate in theory, it can only change the medium through which they transact, which in the long run, does nothing to shift the balance of power to the people, and away from banks. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "name": "t1_dw246ls", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Bitcoin/comments/85zv32/yes_banks_want_crypto_currency_to_fail_heres_why/dw246ls/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1521681372.0, "author_flair_text": "redditor for 3 weeks", "created_utc": 1521652572.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Bitcoin", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dw1s0z1", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "cb--", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dw1oe1r", "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "I LOVE these deep insightful comments.\n\nDo let me clarify, though, when I say \"cryptocurrency\" I'm speaking only of those blockchain assets that are trying to displace fiat currencies; there are tons of other projects that are trying to leverage the technology for different and interesting things.\n\nAnd this is where banks might be in some trouble as well.
