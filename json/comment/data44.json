Practices usually require smaller, broken out patches to be done so that its much easier to see what the patch and code is doing. Really doubtful about intentionally &amp;quot;malicious code&amp;quot; being introduced that gets passed the devs. What is probably more likely is that theres some security flaw or someone finds a way to hack bitcoin that the code didn&amp;#39;t intend for. However, as we know, this new blockchain technology will be hard to hack for awhile until hackers and, the technology used to do that, progress to that state as well. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "name": "t1_dw8187t", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Bitcoin/comments/86trp4/how_susceptible_is_bitcoin_development_to/dw8187t/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1521946494.0, "author_flair_text": "redditor for 3 months", "created_utc": 1521917694.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Bitcoin", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_86trp4", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dw8abt9", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "belcher_", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_86trp4", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Bitcoin is not controlled by the developers of any node software.\n\nTake the example of the UASF (which was a method to add segwit to bitcoin) in spring/summer 2017:\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/chris-belcher/a8155df5051bb3e3aa96#the-core-developers-did-not-have-consensus-in-favour-of-the-uasf-yet-it-still-happened\n\nThe Core developer group was against the UASF, yet it still happened.
