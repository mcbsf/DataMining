It&amp;#39;s arguable whether crypto-to-crypto trades &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; qualified as like-kind transactions (and a much, much stronger case can be made that they never have). I don&amp;#39;t have high hopes for this particular initiative, and you should certainly be very up-front about the fact that &lt;strong&gt;crypto-to-crypto trades are currently taxed (in the United States) and should be accounted for accordingly&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Secondly, we want to reduce the capital gains tax rate for both short and long-term digital asset holdings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, I&amp;#39;m not very optimistic about your chances here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With current policy, every time digital assets are used to make a purchase, or when digital assets are converted to fiat, the consumer is forced to pay high capital gains tax on the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily; only if the asset has appreciated in value since acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;crypto\u2019s tremendous market cap&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t phrased very well... &amp;quot;market cap&amp;quot; is a bogus metric in cryptocurrency, easily games and highly misleading. We want cryptocurrency&amp;#39;s tremendous &lt;em&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt; to benefit the economy, but the &amp;quot;market cap&amp;quot; (and especially the cumulative one) isn&amp;#39;t really a meaningful part of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, I might sound pessimistic here, but it sounds like you&amp;#39;re trying to bite off more than you can chew.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "name": "t1_dw7jnu7", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Bitcoin/comments/86pjee/hello_rbitcoin_this_is_jared_derek_from_the/dw7jnu7/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1521924939.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1521896139.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Bitcoin", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 4, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_86pjee", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_86pjee", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_86pjee", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_86pjee", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_86pjee", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_86pjee", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dw7lv0p", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TheBTC-G", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dw7egzm", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Not to be a downer, and I\u2019m by no means an expert on this, but a friend of mine who is a CPA and day trades crypto does indeed file taxes for crypto to crypto trades and is of the opinion that the IRS would never have assessed crypto to crypto as falling under like kind even before the recent tax bill.
