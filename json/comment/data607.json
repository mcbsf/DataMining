Which is questionable. Narrow money is any money or liquid asset that is owned by the central bank. This is a very slippery one. The article is pretty much stating that all of the bitcoin that people own is actually owned by the central bank. Curious. To my knowledge this is false. But hey, I'm not an expert. The math that goes into the $10M per coin is stating that by 2028 ALL of the narrow money in the entire world will be in bitcoin. ($210T divided by 21M bitcoins =$10M per coin. I mean I'm all for mass adoption, but with the state we are in currently, I find it very far fetched to see bitcoin becoming the only currency used in only 10 years.

While I was on the site, I noticed a stat that was tucked away. Bitcoin's electricity consumption as a pecentage of the world's electricity consumption: 0.26%. Not very high when you think about it.\n\n\nSo I do apologize for calling the article names. However, it is hard to see any value in the article. I think that it is also naive to say that block difficulty is irrelevant here. Lower block difficulty=less hashing power needed to mine a block=less electricity needed to mine a block. If the hashing power is lower in 2028 than it is now, the whole article is irrelevant.\n\n\nI'll explain this more thoroughly. If the cost of mining out ways the profitability, then people will stop mining. This will drop the hashing power, and in turn drop the difficulty, which will then drop the amount of electricity that is needed to mine each block. Now, you are saying that if someone is making $10M per bitcoin, why would they not mine, in turn creating more hashing power, and using more electricity. But the answer is above. As someone dumps more hashing power into the system, the difficulty will go up, and other miners will not be able to compete and will stop mining. As they stop mining, the hashing power will decrease, etc. Etc. Etc. As I said, this will be a constant part of the evolution of bitcoin. In fact, this was just talked about in detail. Back in February, when the price was approaching $4-5K. At the current difficulty, mining bitcoin was slowly becoming less and less profitable. If a certain price was breached, there would have been a massive reduction in miners, because it would not have been as profitable. This in turn would have lowered the hashing power.

That, or they are printing pure FUD. Either way, the answer is no. The amount of electricity that it takes to mine is not a set variable. Therefore we will not have power consumption issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am certainly no expert, but this is how I see it. Right now the energy consumption is on the &amp;quot;high&amp;quot; side. But as the cost of mining increases (via equipment cost, energy cost, etc) the amount of miners will decrease. (Example: From where I am from a kilowatt hour costs $0.11 non-peak and $0.15 in peak times, it is not as profitable for me to mine as say someone who has free electricity) With the decrease in miners, and effective hash power being contributed towards mining, the difficulty will decrease, and in turn the amount of electricity that it takes to mine a block. The same can happen, but instead of it being the cost of power, it can be the actual difficulty getting too hard for some mining setups.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This will be a constant part of the evolution of bitcoin. Regardless of the price of a single coin. On top of that, you need to take into consideration the halvening. Every four years the reward of mining a block gets halved. So yes, the price of a single bitcoin may go up, but the reward will continue to go down.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "name": "t1_dwg38dn", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Bitcoin/comments/87vk2p/bitcoins_high_mining_cost_means_it_cannot_become/dwg38dn/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1522308387.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1522279587.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Bitcoin", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dwfyf9m", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "biscottigelato", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_87vk2p", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "But how about the energy/power aspect of it?
