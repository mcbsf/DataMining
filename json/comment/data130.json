There is not enough historical data to back this up and more important is that we are past mid-March and still on a downturn.

Bitcoin is simply in a slump.  \n  \nWhether it will continue to slide-down or rise-up is dependent on a few key factors: hype, ease of use, and adoption. The more it is hyped, the more it will rise. The easier it is to use, the more it will rise. The more it is adopted by major retailers and banks, the more it will rise.  \n  \nWhat you see here in the /r/bitcoin echo chamber is a lot of positive talk about hype, about improvements to ease of use, and new retailers adopting it.  But you also here a lot of bad stuff about banks closing bitcoin trader accounts, delayed transactions, lost/stolen bitcoin, etc...

Ask yourself this, today, with the market price around USD 8500:  What if I told you that in June 2019 1 BTC would be worth $70,000...?  Would you think that means BTC would be doing well at that time?  Obviously those owning BTC now would be ecstatic if they knew that would be true.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, let&amp;#39;s fast forward and say BTC rises dramatically and by March 2019 hits an all time high of $155K at its peak, but then drops with a significant sell-off and corrects all the way back down to $70K by June 2019.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not saying I am predicting any of that.  But consider that IF that were to happen, two things are certainly true:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(1) The dramatic rise and subsequent market correction would mirror proportionately what BTC has done since January last year until now, and&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(2) There will be people in June 2019 saying that Bitcoin &amp;quot;is doing bad&amp;quot; because it fell all the way from $155K down to $70K. Those who don&amp;#39;t have it will look for any opportunity to needle those who do.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "name": "t1_dw5wq57", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Bitcoin/comments/86jxlm/bitcoin_is_doing_bad/dw5wq57/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1521847179.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1521818379.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Bitcoin", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_86jxlm", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dw6fxhm", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "cypher437", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_86jxlm", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Bitcoin has done exceptionally well, ask your friends how their house is doing...", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin has done exceptionally well, ask your friends how their house is doing...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "name": "t1_dw6fxhm", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Bitcoin/comments/86jxlm/bitcoin_is_doing_bad/dw6fxhm/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1521864507.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1521835707.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Bitcoin", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_86jxlm", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 0, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_86jxlm", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_86jxlm", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_86jxlm", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dw8dktg", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "crypto-anon", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dw814d1", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "-&gt;\"Obviously violent\". \n\n-&gt;You have no evidence of that whatever.
