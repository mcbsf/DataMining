You can use your loss carryover from previous years against an &lt;em&gt;unlimited&lt;/em&gt; amount of capital gains in a later tax year, up to the amount of the carryover, of course. &lt;em&gt;In addition&lt;/em&gt;, you can  apply up to $3k of carryover loss against your ordinary income per year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, let&amp;#39;s say that you had a bad year where you ended up with a net loss of $10k. For that tax year, you apply $3k against your ordinary income, leaving you with a carryover of $7k. Next year, you net a $2k gain. First, you apply $2k of carryover loss to that gain, then you deduct $3k from your income, leaving you with a carryover loss of $2k. In the next year after that, you net a gain of $3k. You deduct $2k from that gain and pay taxes on the $1k of gain that remained. Since you used up all of your carryover losses against your gains, you are unable to deduct anything from you ordinary income. $0 of carryover loss remains for the next year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "name": "t1_dw2asyl", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Bitcoin/comments/861uuc/psa_if_you_havent_done_your_taxes_yet_get_to_it/dw2asyl/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1521687096.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1521658296.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Bitcoin", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_861uuc", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 7, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_861uuc", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_861uuc", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 3, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_861uuc", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 0, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_861uuc", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_861uuc", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_861uuc", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 1, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_861uuc", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 0, "name": "t1__", "id": "_", "parent_id": "t1_dw6gw3s", "depth": 10, "children": []}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dw6gw3s", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "spittingblood", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dw6f2yv", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Whatever man, you dont know me.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever man, you dont know me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "name": "t1_dw6gw3s", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Bitcoin/comments/861uuc/psa_if_you_havent_done_your_taxes_yet_get_to_it/dw6gw3s/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1521865417.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1521836617.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Bitcoin", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 9, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dw6f2yv", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "JD_321", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dw6dusg", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "You can only claim 100% of losses if you have enough gains in that year also to claim them against.
