So lets say I buy a cheeseburger and for it in btc. The btc is deducted from my wallet and transferred to the vendor. Done its paid for. The value of bitcoin doesn&amp;#39;t change, it only changes hands- the value still stays with-in the btc market.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could be wrong isn&amp;#39;t there a transaction fee associated? If so it does not convert 100% and not to mention gets taxed too?\nAlso as I have mentioned in other posts bitcoin does not retain value because its similar to gambling AND is a very very bad version of stock market which also gets dominated by fear and speculation but atleast in stock market the financial health of the company will guarantee its bounce back unless ofcourse it looses trust of people case point Equifax and now FB, but we all know that train derails and has been doing so for bitcoin even more often.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is dominated by fear simply because there is no logic. Bitcoin is good only for day-traders I guess. Long run users are in for real heartbreaks.\nWhen whales pump and dump everyone else jumps.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "name": "t1_dwh0rme", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Bitcoin/comments/87y0yh/why_cant_bitcoin_retain_its_value/dwh0rme/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1522358648.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1522329848.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Bitcoin", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "approved_at_utc": null, "ups": 2, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_87y0yh", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dwhn5w1", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Crypto-AUT", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_87y0yh", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Your absolutely right.
