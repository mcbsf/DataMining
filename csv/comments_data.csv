Problem is, it works like start-up equity. If you have very little equity in BTC, there's no point working for free to try and increase your equity through making the platform better. You end up going on to make a shitcoin and try to get rich off that. It's all about getting rich - very few people in the ecosystem actually here to destroy the banking cartel and restore individual financial sovereignty to the human race. Simply about money - that's it.

Unless people shelve their greed and shitcoin delusions, and start developing for Bitcoin, things are going to move very, very slowly.

Things that should have already been implemented (they have been a topic of discussion for over two years now!):  
- MAST  
- Schnorr Signatures  
- Lightning

20	all_the_keks	"- exit scams, spoofing, wash trading, exchanges busting their own customers on margin, etc

- here's a good one:  bitcoin can only handle 3 transactions per second. Now, multiply that by the length of a human life in seconds. Then divide by the number of people on the planet. Tell me: how many transactions per lifetime can bitcoin handle if it is successful and everyone is using it?  (post up your calculations please)

- the fact that after 10 years of bitcoin and 30-something years of distributed consensus databases no practical use has been found for blockchain

- the fact that no one* is using it as a payment system, and everyone is using it as a casino with virtual horses   (* for large values of zero)

- transactions may or may not complete

- if they do complete it might take days or weeks

- vulnerability to attacks (hacks, one miner already having control of 35% of mining, etc.)

- transactions might cost $20 or $0 depending on the mood of the market... oh wait, that's just the tip! Actually every single transaction costs $100s when we include the people subsidising each transaction block by paying miners for their coins...  $100s!!! wtf. The calculation here is:  Number of bitcoins awarded per block mined * cost of a bitcoin in USD divided by number of transactions per block. Do the calculation, post up your results please. 

- daily volatility of the value of your payment is up to 20%.... what ? Imagine if your paycheck at work had that kind of volatility of a monthly basis, never mind a daily basis. 

- the fact it is inherently worth less than zero (due to the expense of maintaining the network) and serves no useful purpose that isn't served by existing fiat currencies

- it is not anonymous, unlike paper cash

- the fact that after ten years the only people who find it interesting are crooks and the desperate poor

- the fact it is ruining the environment with vast amounts of wasted energy

- fraud/theft are non-reversible

- Groupies. With cash/bank/visa etc I don't need to listen to whiny 20-somethings telling me how staring at their balance gave them stronger erections or whatever. 

- For example, you know what isn't a thing? /r/ordinarybankpayment, /r/iusedmyvisacardtodayanditworked, /r/walletfullofcash

- No need to worry about being tricked/trojaned by 'helpful apps' etc with online banking.

- No need to try and read white papers and figure out what the fuck is going on with cash, banks etc. It just works.

- 60% of cash in the world isn't owned by some random fucking mystery guy and his 30 buddies. 5% of the world's cash isn't owned by one random guy.

Now compare all of the above against e.g. making a bank transfer at your bank (in europe, this is free, almost instant, and reversible in the case of fraud) or a payment on your visa/masterard (again, in europe at least, this is free, instant, guaranteed against fraud or poor service).

Oh and you know what I don't need to worry about when I pay for something with cash, bank payment or visa? The IRS/tax authority coming and demanding a capital gains calculation and tax payment, which IS a problem for bitcoin that will never go away.

Anyway best of luck to all you bitcoiners and you are all welcome to come join us over on /r/buttcoin when you see the light :)

If I were making the graphic, I would take all 365 or 366 days in a particular year, and sort them largest to smallest.  Then start down the list from top to bottom, trying to figure out how few it takes to exceed the combined gains for the year.  

That is what it appears that they did for 2013, and 2015-2017.  But 2014 makes no sense.   If 2014 was a down year, all it took was the top ONE day to exceed all days combined.  Yet they show ten days for some reason.

151	pistonian	The reason so many people see it coming back in summer is this prediction which mirrors the 2013 bitcoin bubble crash and resurgence. There was an initial run up, then fall, then a major skyrocket. That’s what they are seeing - a repeat of that bubble. I have copied that bubble onto the graph now and it matches. May not mean shit but for 11 months now it’s been almost perfect. https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/884qso/wondering_where_the_bottom_is_me_too_take_a_look/	1522473460.0	2018-04-01 16:00:10.989901	dwjtod3	t3_88bjby	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88bjby/bitcoin_price_trading_in_a_range_below_7000_tom/dwjtod3/	2	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	2

151	pistonian	The reason so many people see it coming back in summer is this prediction which mirrors the 2013 bitcoin bubble crash and resurgence. There was an initial run up, then fall, then a major skyrocket. That’s what they are seeing - a repeat of that bubble. I have copied that bubble onto the graph now and it matches. May not mean shit but for 11 months now it’s been almost perfect. https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/884qso/wondering_where_the_bottom_is_me_too_take_a_look/	1522473460.0	2018-04-01 16:32:59.303101	dwjtod3	t3_88bjby	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88bjby/bitcoin_price_trading_in_a_range_below_7000_tom/dwjtod3/	2	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	2

and still people who pay the tax neatly and well, for example the USA $ 25,000 -25% tax. $ 5000 giveaway to the govement. you remain poor with a poor amount.

Be realistic. there is nothing to earn from being good. you can earn money only with little criminal traits. Criminal is not shooting someone dead. Smarter as the government than you are often also criminal where they can not get a view. just being good does not pay and is boring too. The government also belongs to the group of criminals.



Do not just use your headline to look at charts that go up and down and sell on coinbase. If you think a little bit cleverly, just buy and sell your stuff with a piece of paper on a bulletin board in the supermarket where you can buy and sell dirty old junk and all that kind of shit or just on a kind of ebay marketplace

I've never paid a penny tax for it and I'm not going to do it either. I do not act so mysterious about it. I also told the police right in the face when I paid € 6500 in traffic fines last year with all € 50 bills at the police station. Well, there is money you have to work for a long time. I replied that I did not do a fuck and paid no fuck tax. And black money is money too.

But not only against agents.

Have it also right in the face of a tax bailiff who came about a car whine that I have not had for 3 years, where 1 bill of road tax was still open from 3 years old. that it just feels wonderful to have something that they can not pick from you and never pay them a penny for it.

If you want to buy more, consider doing that gradually: weekly, monthly, etc. It will give you a piece of mind. Life is to short to spend it watching the price.

243	WorldLeader	"From the Lightning Network white paper:

&gt; If all Bitcoin transactions were conducted inside a network of micropayment channels, to enable 7 billion people to make two channels per year with unlimited transactions inside the channel, it would require 133 MB blocks (presuming 500 bytes per transaction and 52560 blocks per year). Current generation desktop computers will be able to run a full node with old blocks pruned out on 2TB of storage.

Despite the fact that LN is just a clearinghouse where parties agree to settle the full amount later, there's *still* a huge roadblock given that the most optimistic case requires bitcoin to hard fork up from 1mb to 133mb and that everyone caries around over 2TB just to store the ""pruned"" blockchain.

Perfect information across all nodes comes at the price of speed and size. Unless we use some variant of quantum entanglement to break the current laws of physics, it's just not feasible to build a perfectly uniform, instant, omniscient network.

246	Uvas23	"Bitcoin is improving its throughput by gradual degrees. Even now, the network can handle quite a bit more txs with the increase in segwit adoption and increased batching than it could last December. LN is starting to expand rapidly now that it is out of alpha. No one has any idea how much tx pressure the LN will relieve. It is impossible to know how many txs are being made through the LN network right now.

There are more improvements in the pipeline such as schnorr sigs. These will possibly increase capabilities by another 30%. 

As time goes by, each percentage improvement added will increase tx limit by larger and larger amounts. A 30% increase of 3 tx per second will give 1 additional tx per second. A 30% increase of 9 tx per second will give 3 additional tx per second.

So, projecting this outward, in a few years a new improvement that increases efficiency by a few percent will give an increase far more than what the total network can handle right now.

When purchasing something I click a link, it opens my wallet, I type a password, hit confirm, re-type the password and then it's done.  At no point did I need to do anything that I would consider a hassle.   

At a store I pick a store from a list, an amount and then I have the gift card.  When at the cashier I show them a bar-code, they scan it and the price updates.  Simple really. Most banks will be going this route with your debit card in the future anyway.  I hope you survive.

These aservices are for the people UNLIKE you who already HAVE bitcoin and need ways of spending it.  Everyone who has bitcoin don't give a fuck what you people think as we have the cashier scan out phones. 

I don't take out my wallet.
I don't spend an of the fiat I have in the bank.
I have absolutely risk of someone stealing my credit card number; it's not used.
I have no risk of identity theft as none of it is linked to my identity.  
The cashier scans a bar-card on my phone so I feel futuristic too.

Let's say there are only 1000 bitcoins in total and I have 900 of them. But I want more but fuck paying $10,000 each.

I put in a buy order for $5,000 a coin which obviously are not filled, then I immediate sell 500 coins at $5000 each. Ok so I bought 490 of my own coins at $5000 each some is lost to the legitimate buyers. But now bitcoin average price Is lower since half the total coinage was just moved for half it's old price.

I do this a few times and you panic sell yours.

unless it was gifted to you. They always think in terms of turning it back.
Try to think of a world with no fiat
It’s coming sooner than you think 
There is and continues to be gazillions
of fiat being printed out of thin air
worth less and less every day unlike most crypto
Fiat is falling more than crypto is and the dollar is doomed
Just look at real estate for example
And you ain’t seen nothing yet
You can’t compare fiat with crypto
Crypto is the emerging exchange
It can’t be thought of in terms of fiat
if you see the big picture 
Invest in your future if you see one
Never put in anything you can not afford to loose as a result of wanting to go back
Is this ringing any bells ???

I used this platform of fortune 48hoursbitcoin.com exactly 16:00pm Wednesday and got my payout today. Exactly 48 hours later.
I was sceptical about it at 1st because of the bad comments on here and how evil the world can be but then life is all about taking risk and I grew enough balls to take it and boom my bitcoin got doubled in 48 hours. It is a legitimate company guys!! You all should benefit from this now the price of bitcoin is a bit low.

Is not about if this is going to impact or not on bitcoin. This is actually going to impact in any industry in the world.

What I’m noting is that this is a clear articulation of a notice with the only purpose of generating any connection between Elon and crypto.

And yes, with some few  exceptions, this has became a low quality sub. Just look at the top post of everyday. Mostly users more worried about the USD value of the bitcoin. 

What an irony! We are here trying to disrupt the monetary system while celebrating USD earnings!

I don't say it can't be done, I just say, I don't know if it is economically feasible at the very moment of technology.

I don't say it can't be done, I just say, I don't know if it is economically feasible at the very moment of technology.

Bitcoin's algo intentionally makes mining hard, and miners are willing to operate at the current profit margins, i.e. with the current costs of mining per block won. Cheaper mining would just cause the difficulty to rise accordingly.	1522514780.0	2018-04-01 16:32:59.374101	dwkmb1n	t3_88cjiv	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88cjiv/intel_files_patent_for_energyefficient_bitcoin/dwkmb1n/	2	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	2

sufficiently higher price per Terahash in equipment costs for the hardware).

This doesn't mean mining will use less energy;  this means more computation per unit of energy,  And   when people upgrade to new hardware the network's hashrate and thus the difficulty will increase over time.

>>>>>>> 11372210fd131674b9abc31d83d13392b2c55c4b

Since crypto is so volatile it needs a higher average ATH growth to justify the risk, unless it can on average grow faster than other sectors with growth potential it is now wise to invest more than a portion in it.

If crypto grows to 5 Trillion (adjusted for inflation) in 20 years it will probably not have been the best sector for long term investments.

Bitcoin has been trading in a range and going lower and lower.  A couple days ago I told my buddy I thought bitcoin was gonna hit 6500.  A new 3 month low.  It did.  If on this rebound it exceeds 9000 I do think it will start going higher.  I would bet against it.  I imagine it will cap out a little over 8500.  If on this rebound it doesn't exceed 9000 it will go lower than 6500.

Bitcoin is ahead of it's time and there are only so many uses for it.  It is good for drugs, hackers, and dodging sanctions or war.  Hackers and war are about the same thing.  This means the chances of regulation are high.  Which ever coin can dodge the law is going to win.  I would bet against Bitcoin.  I like Monero myself.  266 billion seems super high to me even though I think demand for a war/crime cryoto is in excess of 2 trillion dollars.  I am not convinced that countries like Russia and North Korea can feel confident enough in Bitcoin to invest heavily enough in it at this time.

Bitcoin has been trading in a range and going lower and lower.  A couple days ago I told my buddy I thought bitcoin was gonna hit 6500.  A new 3 month low.  It did.  If on this rebound it exceeds 9000 I do think it will start going higher.  I would bet against it.  I imagine it will cap out a little over 8500.  If on this rebound it doesn't exceed 9000 it will go lower than 6500.

Bitcoin is ahead of it's time and there are only so many uses for it.  It is good for drugs, hackers, and dodging sanctions or war.  Hackers and war are about the same thing.  This means the chances of regulation are high.  Which ever coin can dodge the law is going to win.  I would bet against Bitcoin.  I like Monero myself.  266 billion seems super high to me even though I think demand for a war/crime cryoto is in excess of 2 trillion dollars.  I am not convinced that countries like Russia and North Korea can feel confident enough in Bitcoin to invest heavily enough in it at this time.

The answer is 50/50. 
No need to say thank you ;)

The only question to solve the problem now is:
How confortable you are with the psychology of risk and control in your life ? 

If you are confortable with risk and don't care about absolute control: buy now and live your life. You'll cash out in 3 years. 

If you are not confortable with risk and don't care  about control: leave the cryptospace asap.

I've been involved in crypto since 2012 and I've seen it go from nerdy people/people who hate banks/people who want change in the way we transact with money, to ultra bro-ish wannabe ""investors"" who act like they know what they're talking about because they read a wikiHow on investing but have no fucking idea what they're doing. The community around crypto fucking sucks, and it drives people away faster than any price dip.

It's so fucking pompous to be like ""Well you shouldn't have invested more than you could handle 🙃"" to someone who is like ""this sucks, I lost money"". Y'all were screaming ""BUY BUY BUY"" and ""MILLION DOLLAR BTC!!!"" in December and a lot of people bought into the hype. Now you're shaming them for that?

<<<<<<< HEAD
You want adopters? Stop being dicks. Bitcoin isn't an investment platform, it's a new currency.

I don't see it as shaming, but rather as pointing out what people did wrong. It's not Bitcoin's fault you lost money, but your own. It's not market manipulator's fault you took a loan to buy Bitcoin, but your own. It's not bad timing that got you in trouble, but your decision.

It's the same as getting burned in a pyramid scheme back in school, the lesson sticks well if you take care to think it through and assign the blame to the only part that you have an ability to change - yourself.

Blockchain is worthless without a valuable token as a reward for securing the network.  Many of the “next-gen” blockchains, like tracking chickens from the egg to the market, would be better suited for a traditional SQL database. 

Government issued and controlled cryptocurrencies are just digital currencies, like the electronic money in your traditional bank account. They’re nothing new and they’re certainly not transformative. 

The fixed supply of bitcoins is the main reason why they are valuable. Scarcity drives demand and demand correlates to higher value.  Many of the altcoins that have no cap (or a ridiculous cap) are going to leave their fans holding the bag as cryptocurrencies go mainstream.

I wouldn't be surprised if soon we sour right back to 15K before tumbling again... because you know... there's money to be made with shorting.

You're trying to put the genie back in the bottle. You don't look back when you are progressing. Microsoft and Steam don't want to go back, and I don't blame them. This is the kind of stupid sentimental bullshit I'm seeing all over this subreddit now that the sky is falling.

Relax, everything will be fine, but it's going to take longer than you hope. The **future** of Bitcoin is a back-end to the lightning network. It's going to be a few months (at least) before this tech begins earning the trust it will deserve. There's still at least one major gotcha that needs addressed:

As far as I can tell, the biggest problem is that the client now has to deal with channel state information, which is a job that should be on a server, but putting info like that on a server undermines the trustless nature of the whole thing, so we're back to square one. Nobody can make a straightforward, usable client with the actual benefits of a digital currency (e.g. your money is an abstract concept that isn't tied to a device) without solving this problem first.

That doesn't mean it won't work out. Technical problems always have technical solutions, and this is the first generation of software devs who are aware of trustless technology, making them qualified to solve this simple problem. It just means the necessary hoops must be jumped through by our fearless devs before the price chart starts mooning again. I envision an outcome where a trustless solution for lightning manifests so someone can't lose their channel state and bitcoin by dropping their phone in a lake. Not because it's possible, but because it's necessary.

I send and receive bitcoin quite frequently. I work in custom designing and altering women’s clothing... gets really busy around prom season. Last year I gave clients the option to pay in BTC. As winter strolled around, more people were offering. Not crowds of people but more than last year. 

This prom season I have parents and high school kids asking how to setup their wallets. 

I have a client in Canada who sent me her dress to redesign with some new fabric. We’re skipping PayPal since her private information was hacked. So we’re doing bitcoin this year,

932	newprofile15	My point is that 99.99999% of all transaction activity with bitcoin has been solely for the purpose of speculation.

Edit: oh wait MS dumped it in January and has brought it back (for now).  Guarantee they will dump it again in the future.  Fees are only low now because (big surprise) no one is using it.

950	phish73	Probably FOMO and hype leading to over speculation and the expected resulting correction which started at 20k and is shown through the numerous technical analysis charts with indicators like bear pennant formation and the death cross, low volume buying along with no new institutional money coming in leading to the eventual decline into 5k or 3k or 2.5k. if you think we are at the bottom you are in for a shock. But this has happened before and it may very well rise to newer highs, but let go of HODL mentality right now and buy back when u see very low volatility, it will take years to recover. 	1522456326.0	2018-04-01 16:00:11.103902	dwjc9gu	t1_dwj9kdl	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88a0i9/dont_let_the_negativity_get_you_down_the_future/dwjc9gu/	4	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	4

The person who computed the most has a higher chance, but isn't automatically the winner. 

It's exactly the same, except instead of lottery with GPU power, it's a lottery with HDD space.

Not really. Difficulty determines the break-even point and difficulty follows price.

Profitable? It depends how long you think your mining equipment will last. If you want it to pay back the purchase price in 8 months, then it's not profitable  

&gt; I would also assume that btc mining difficulty has increase steadily

That assumption makes no sense. If mining becomes unprofitable, miners will leave, the hash rate will decrease and the difficulty will fall  

<<<<<<< HEAD
No sign of the hash rate decreasing so far, therefore the miners are not leaving, so they must be optimistic. Either they believe the price will increase, or they think their equipment will keep creating a few dollars per day for 2 years, or they're waiting for everyone else to leave first"	1522510553.0	2018-04-01 16:00:11.117398	dwkklsc	t3_88gioi	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88gioi/is_it_still_profitable_for_miners_to_mine_btc_at/dwkklsc/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

What I am not sure about is the lead time to those changes.  Fairly easy to stop mining and switch to an alt, but difficult for new miners to ramp up (buy and configure the hardware).	1522529552.0	2018-04-01 16:32:59.503603	dwksncq	t1_dwkhu9w	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88gioi/is_it_still_profitable_for_miners_to_mine_btc_at/dwksncq/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

That’s the point of bitmain cash. Otherwise they would have given it another name, like the thousand other altcoins that have unique names.

Bitmain Cash is a coin issued by Bitmain and marketed by Roger Ver. Roger Ver got incredible rich thanks to bitcoin, but for some reason his entire career is based on frustrating progress and adoption as much as possible. The most likely reason he hates bitcoin so much is because he can get more money fooling people into buying his scams."	1522545777.0	2018-04-01 16:32:59.508102	dwl5nuu	t3_88jxkb	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88jxkb/what_is_the_point_of_bitcoin_cash/dwl5nuu/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

Well then, since Europe runs the whole world...

Seriously though...anyone publishing personal information to an immutable blockchain should understand that they're creating a permanent record. The onus is on them.

Most courts base judgements on the basis of what a person may find to be reasonable. I.e. law is interpreted it is not taken literally unless its an extreme case.

That's why case law generally leans on precedent.

Prosecuting someone is akin to fitting a square peg in a round hole. E.g. the law will clearly state the rules, whereas a crime might vaguely fit some of those rules.

In the world of criminal law there are two things that need to be clear. Mens rea and actus reus. I.e. did someone do it, and did they intend to carry out a crime?

In the case of holding a copy of a blockchain, all you can prove is that they have a copy of the blockchain. You can't prove that they intended to commit a crime on the strength of them simply having a copy of the blockchain and in pretty much all cases, the holder of the copy intends to commit no crime.

Therefore, a sound judge and a crew of intelligent lawyers would not pass a judgement against the use and/or ownership of a copy of an immutable blockchain via GDPR.

Finally, is GDPR a threat? No. GDPR is a regulatory framework (the hint is in the name) designed to help organisations and individuals understand what data they can hold, how long they hold it and the rights of the people the data came from.

This is sensationalist bollocks. The author of this article is a twat and doesn't understand how the law works and can't tell the difference between a criminal law and a regulatory act.

So people bought Bitcoin even though they didn't think it would achieve its aim. So they bought it when it was going up to ""make money"" but actually, they lost money, so they sell to cut their losses knowing they can buy back in.

Certain members of the community are trying to promote LN as some sort of banking takeover that will replace normal bitcoin transactions because it suits there agenda but the reality is that it is just an extension with a specific purpose.

For normal people with a LN wallet they lifecycle will look like:

* Open Channel
* Spend Channel
* Close Channel

It was never meant to replace receiving funds for normal users, it is just meant to make paying someone instant &amp; secure because 0-conf is fundamentally broken and always has been.

Remember, it may take hundreds of milliseconds just to transit a few networks, *nothing* is instant. 

And if your node is CPU-bound for a second or your connection has a latency spike, you lose transactions?  That's just not workable.  It *has* to be on the same order as TCP timeouts, practically speaking.

This is why we built an invoice system: you provide me a request for payment, I pay.  There is no offline receipt without trusted third parties (though Schnorr will enable invoice reuse, so you could have an unsolicited payment).

The only good news is that the  trend towards always being online in some form is in our favor here. I can eventually see a system where your phone gets a ping to complete an incoming payment, not to mention IoT style lightning nodes.

Not exactly true.  The touted benefits of the LN isn't just instant transactions, it has been sold as a method to scale Bitcoin.  LN transactions are supposed to be much cheaper than Bitcoin transactions and if the mempool is perpetually clogged with a fee market (as planned) ""eventually"" can turn into never.

1346	sfoonit	"Reasonably safe? That depends on if the interest rates are low enough. From 2009-2010 up until today, if you bought the S&amp;P on margin (50-50 equity-debt), you would have done extremely well. 

Personally I think it makes sense to use (a lot) of margin after a healthy correction. Say the stock market index drops 30 or 40% tomorrow. Then you double down and BTFD. Just make sure the equity buffer is sufficient so you don't suffer a margin call. And make sure you have an extra buffer for a further decline. This should be relatively easy with portfolio margin.

I borrowed some extra money from my brokerage to invest in crypto, at 1.5% per annum. Mainly because I didn't want to sell my stocks (because some of my holdings generate a 2% dividend) + generate good capital gains. Given I can't be crypto margin called on that, and I have plenty of equity in my brokerage account (won't be margin called there either), I'm pretty comfortable with doing that. Of course my crypto investment could go in the red or to zero, but that's a risk I'm willing to take.

I also think my example is a reasonable approach to taking on debt, as opposed to people investing in crypto on a credit card at a 10 or 15% interest rate."	1522455629.0	2018-04-01 16:32:59.552100	dwjbiwi	t1_dwjb7zl	/r/Bitcoin/comments/889q62/trader_threatens_to_commit_suicide_by_drinking/dwjbiwi/	6	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	6

Less miners would mean blocks are mined later than the 10 minute interval. The difficulty is adjusted after every 2016 blocks are mined. After the adjustment, it's usually back to 10 minute blocks until mining power changes. Block here means an entry in the blockchain. A transaction is only confirmed once it gets included in a block and added to the blockchain.

Aside from other reasons like security of the network, the 10 minute interval is put in there to control the ""release"" of bitcoins. If you're still not aware, there could only be 21M bitcoin in circulation. Almost 17M is in circulation now, with around 4M yet to be ""mined"".

I can't be the only one that's noticed these kinds of comments being posted all over this sub lately, and nearly all of them are from &lt; 2 month old accounts (mostly just a few days / weeks). Did these ""Redditors"" all just happen to independently create their accounts within the last month or two just to rub the downtrend in our faces / spread FUD? Or is there something more nefarious going on?     
     
My guess is that it's a mix of both, but mostly the latter. I know there are plenty of skeptics out there who have been itching for the chance to say ""I told you so"" to the greater crypto community, but that doesn't explain all of the ""bitcoin is going down to [insert low number here]"" comments. It's too bad we don't have any way of proactively weeding out trolls/shills/fudsters. I try to report them to the mods whenever I see them, but it's a losing battle due to the fact that it costs nothing to create an account on Reddit. Maybe accounts with an age less than a year shouldn't be able to comment here at all, but that would obviously exclude all of the well-intentioned noobs. Not sure if there's any good solution, but I can see why the quality of the discussions on this sub have declined so much in the past year or so.

If I may add couple more problems it solved: 5. The issue of seizure of property (which is a great tool for every autocratic regime in history, often following the pattern of first seizure of property followed by a genocide of by then helpless group). 6. It opened a whole new financial market to the social groups that would never participate in financial markets otherwise. Also this market is (still) beyound the reach of traditional institutional players. 7. It provided a whole new global economy that allows people from developing countries to break free from the circle of poverty. 8. It provides way to move your funds in a relatively untraceable way (and constantly getting better at it). 9. It provides a currency for clandestine economy further undermining idiotic war on drugs.

And as for buying groceries the solution of that issue is around the corner, with the full implementation of LN there will sooner than later be a reasonable payment processor that will allow you to pay for whatever you want with Bitcoin. For me that is not the real measure of adoption, I will consider it a complete success when it becomes such a standard payment protocol that you'll be able to use it even without knowing you do.

1438	Zorander22	"&gt;You might say, ""well, it's decentralized"". So what? What issue am I having with my ""centralized"" US dollar? None. Is the fear that the USD will collapse? I don't see that happening in my lifetime....but I have seen bitcoin collapse multiple times.

I think there are a few responses to this. One is that the value of the USD is collapsing gradually over time through inflation (note: many people think a consistent low inflation rate is a good thing for the economy).  For example, since the year 2000, the value of the USD had decreased by about 30%. If we go to 1980, 33 cents would be worth the equivalent of $1 today. If we go back 100 years, 6 cents then is worth the equivalent of $1 today. The USD (and other inflationary currencies) have been collapsing consistently, year over year - it just happens slowly enough that we don't notice it much.

In trusting a central authority, you are trusting the decisions of the central bank and government now, and indefinitely into the future. Many people don't want to do that. With Bitcoin, the code is open-source, and the amount of currency, how it's added and when is all mathematically laid out. In this sense, there is less trust required for Bitcoin compared to trusting a government.

Another advantage of a decentralized currency is that most countries stick with their own currency. Adopting the currency of another country would give them a large amount of control over your economy. Bitcoin is not affiliated with any particular country or group, so it may allow people to have a truly global currency, removing the inefficiencies and barriers caused when trading with people from other countries.

&gt;Ok, well I read an article about how bitcoin is taking off in Africa because their local currencies are very unstable and prone to hyper-inflation. This would make sense to me.....again, if bitcoin were stable, but it's not. It's down 22% over the past week. Wouldn't these people have had better luck converting their money into USD or gold?

It is extremely easy to make money if you have a time machine. You know what works out and what didn't. Bitcoin overall has been increasing in value as the technology improves, as more people become interested and want to try it or use it, and for speculative purposes. If Bitcoin shoots up next week to increase in value 50% does that change how you'd see their decision? 

Presumably, Bitcoin's extreme volatility is due to its place in the financial system still being uncertain. It may ultimately prove to be worth nothing (or close to it), though personally I find that unlikely. It may end up to be worth a great deal. The swings in value are in part due to changes in sentiment about the future of Bitcoin, and in part people playing financial games, speculating and trying to guess what other people are going to do. If Bitcoin becomes a major part of the financial system, it would almost certainly have a more stable value.

&gt;That brings me to my next point. Bitcoin is slow. Last week I decided to put my money where my mouth is and (attempt to) make a bitcoin purchase through Newegg. It was honestly kind of a pain in the ass. Once I had the wallet all set up, I went to coinbase to buy my bitcoin. Had to verify identity and bank account, which took a couple days and didn't feel very anonymous. Then I went to buy my bitcoin....oh, it's going to take a week before I can actually access my coins?? That's stupid. Guess what also happened in that week? Bitcoin went from $8700 to $6800. Awesome!

&gt;Then I went to send the money to my wallet. Ok, that also takes forever. While I was waiting for it to confirm, I started reading up on the delays. I saw that during the bitcoin rush, it could take days for transactions to confirm. Also, you can pay a higher fee to have your transaction confirm faster. Ok, that's stupid. Anyway, the whole process of getting set up to buy bitcoin was annoying and drawn out and again, for what benefit? I planned on making a purchase through Newegg. I could have just used my credit card and completed the purchase in seconds. Instead, I waited weeks and ultimately decided to wait in hopes that the value of bitcoin comes back up first. Fun.

There are many things going on in here. It sounds like you're comparing getting everything set up in Bitcoin to you already having a credit card. You can use local bitcoins rather than a standard exchange if you want them quickly and more anonymously. Or you could sell something for them too.

Right now, minimal transaction fees are going through in the next block, so your transfer taking forever is a little strange. Using Bitcoin at a brick and mortar store and waiting for many confirmations and waiting for hours would certainly be overkill. As you mentioned, lightning is now in beta, and for two people who are using lightning, transactions are nearly instant with negligible fees.

There was a short span of time when transactions were getting delayed and fees were getting ridiculous. Since that time, exchanges have been batching transactions, and more people have adopted segwit, both of which reduce this problem for increase in transactions in the future. Lightning allows transactions to happen off-chain, helping solve the problem in a different way. Other solutions are still being worked on - people are constantly working to improve how Bitcoin functions."	1522452117.0	2018-04-01 16:32:59.676598	dwj7te4	t3_88aqb2	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88aqb2/my_opinion_on_bitcoin_its_pointless/dwj7te4/	20	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	20

1452	enigmapulse	"I'm not going to address all of the points you raised up, because I don't have the time to do so properly at the moment, but I would like to touch on a few of the points.

1) Your initial set up with an exchange is analogous to the set-up you did when you first applied to your credit card.  It's ""unfair"" to attribute that start-up cost to ""bitcoin as a whole"" but ignore it when you used the credit card.

2) You do not have to wait for multiple confirmations before a vendor will give you your purchase.  Like credit cards, BTC txns are ""near instant"" for the spender, but take a moment for the seller - i.e. when you use your credit card, Visa doesn't instantaneously add the money into the coffers of the seller, they're made available at a later date.  In addition, Lightning Network goes a long way towards making this exchange truly instantaneous between buyer and seller, but without the need of the middleman.

3) With Visa, the merchant pays the 2-3% fee, and frequently that is built into the price of the item you're purchasing.  With Bitcoin, the buyer sees that fee explicitly, but it's often just a couple of cents (I paid a nickel on a $100 purchase, far less than 2%).  Because of this, a hypothetical world where Bitcoin was the primary currency *should* see a small reduction in the prices of items because the total fee is measurably smaller.

4) Africa doesn't care about the USD exchange rate.  1 BTC = 1 BTC regardless of how the 1 BTC = X USD equation fluctuates.  The people you read about in Africa are operating in that ""hypothetical world 
 where Bitcoin is the primary currency"" I just alluded to.  Because they never interact with a BTC/USD exchange, it's irrelevant to them.  Another way to convey this point would be to consider what happens when the USD loses or gains value relative to the Euro - you don't suddenly start seeing rising or falling prices in a USD-based store due to that.  The same would be true in an environment with BTC-based stores.

5) I fully admit that BTC still has a long way to grow before it's ""first-world ready."" There are a lot of things which still need to be worked on (ease of use being a big one), you need to understand a very important point.  None of those services you are accustomed to are intrinsically part of the USD.  If you live on the East Coast, try buying something from California using only cash (paper money).  You'd have to mail it to them, trust that they received it and were honest about it, etc.  Visa, Venmo, Loans, Credit Card Perks, and all the other stuff that's ""missing from Bitcoin"" are all actually built ""on top of"" the dollar, and are not fundamentally part of the dollar itself.  We're still building these things, but there is nothing about Bitcoin that would prevent them from becoming a reality.

6) Living in the US, you and I are lucky that we have a relatively stable government and economy.  This may not always be true.  Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Greece, and others may seem like ""they'd never happen here"" but if you go back in time a few years, you'd hear the same sentiment in each of those countries.  In fact, every government in the history of mankind has collapsed at some point - so there is no reason to believe that the ones which exist today will exist forever.  This might sound a tad fearmongerish, and to a certain degree it is, but I'm including it just to help illustrate the point.

7) The world is becoming increasingly globalized.  International trade, mobility, and indeed everything is only increasing as time and technology improves.  In that world, it doesn't make sense to have a currency which is only valid in specific regions, or which can be manipulated by a small set of actors.  The world needs a global currency if it wants to transacts globally.  And it wants to transact globally.  It doesn't make sense for that currency to be backed by a single government, or perhaps even any governmental body at all.  Will that global currency be Bitcoin?  Who knows.  But it's the best candidate we have right now."	1522454840.0	2018-04-01 16:32:59.677599	dwjaorr	t3_88aqb2	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88aqb2/my_opinion_on_bitcoin_its_pointless/dwjaorr/	12	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	12

Few saw the problems that were being solved.  Take away email/the internet today and society collapses.  Bitcoin has the capability of solving many problems.

Problem 1 - fees
Fees eat into every financial transaction from companies paying companies to you buying coffee with your credit card.  Fees are eating into value.

Problem 2 - trust
Financial transaction require previous trust.  IE: You trust your bank to not take your paycheck when you deposit it.  Bitcoin does not require trust and functions as a no-trust|verify instead system.

Problem 3 - control
Money is a system of control used by governments since the inception of money.  Control the money control the population.  Bitcoin removes this control.  Funds cannot be seized and supply of the currency cannot be manipulated.

These problems will only become more relevant as time goes on as the internet has proved previously."	1522457964.0	2018-04-01 16:32:59.677599	dwje0b3	t3_88aqb2	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88aqb2/my_opinion_on_bitcoin_its_pointless/dwje0b3/	8	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	8

1456	Rand0mpeeps	"   Great post. Might as well down vote me now.  I was an early fan on Bitcoin and the block chain technology behind it. Still am, but as a currency, it is no good. As an investment, it is still no good.  Use it if you want to support it but please do not think it will become mainstream in 5 years or so. I don't see that happening anytime soon. 
   Remember that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. None. So the price of Bitcoin is what people are willing to pay for it. As people bought Bitcoin while the price has gone up, what do you think those people did once they realize the price was going down? They started selling. Hence the price keeps going down. 
  What I believe will happen is that you will see a stready support for Bitcoin at a lower level until the next new thing happens and it will be another great story of the internet like AOL, IRC, that guy who sold is webpage ads per pixel and so forth. Bitcoins have a lot of competition.
   Also when you bring up an argument against the current use of Bitcoin, someone always brings up the white paper and asks if you read it.  Let me help you out, read it first because it does not do anything other than confuse non technical people. The way I see it if Gramps can't understand it, than it's too complicated for the masses.
    Also will tell you that all governments fail and so on and point to a country in crisis like Venezuela (I think someone has already).  Did you see the news reports about people begging for bitcoins on the street? No? That is because they want food, water, medical is what they are begging for. Do you think cryptocoins matters to them if they have no electricity or internet?  Basically cryptocoins are a first world technology and still need a structure to work on. 
   What I do see happening is using the block chain technology to speed up wire transfers and other things.  That I am sure will be mainstream soon."	1522461357.0	2018-04-01 16:32:59.677599	dwjhmcg	t3_88aqb2	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88aqb2/my_opinion_on_bitcoin_its_pointless/dwjhmcg/	6	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	6
1457	chadsterlington	"Yup, I agree with you. Don't they say if you have to explain a joke, it isn't funny? Well if you have read the white paper to understand why bitcoin is valuable......

Anyway, I agree that as soon as the next tech trend comes along, people will forget about bitcoin. My point was that there has to be a legitimate use for it in order for people to adopt and I just don't see that. Sure, people might hold it for a little longer as an ""investment"", but that's it. 

It's supposed to be a currency. Does anyone pay their rent with it? No. Get paid in it? No. Buy groceries with it? No. Hypothetically, if they do, is it a better alternative to paying via check, c/c or cash? No. Is it a better alternative for peer to peer transfer than something like venmo or paypal? No. So even if it does gain some traction, I don't see it being a better alternative to technology and methods that are already out there. People can use buzzwords like ""decentralized"" and ""blockchain technology"" all they want, but most people don't care about that. 

I do agree with you that it could be used for wire transfers or international transactions on a small scale, but I just don't see it being commonplace.

Banks and credit card companies and PayPal solve it by being a central authority who check each transaction to ensure they’re legitimate. Bitcoin solves it in a different, decentralised, way. 

No solution is objectively better. Each has pros and cons. But bitcoin’s is new and people are still figuring out how to best make use of it and how to improve on it. 

It might end up as a niche technology with limited use....and the price will stay low.

Then there are some other properties you mentioned, some really significant, some just interesting.

The central innovation is simply monetary policy. The ideal currency is perfectly predictably scarce. This is not a mainstream opinion but it is the correct one. The debates are well worn by now and everything has been said. Read Rothbard, Mises, Bastiat...

Maintainers of currency adopt the economic policy that suits themselves. These policies must be forced on people since they are evidently not ideal.

Bitcoin has a hard coded perfect monetary policy and cannot succumb to the corruptions of central custodianship. It doesn't look like it can be stopped, despite many very serious attempts to kill it. It's approaching 10 years now.

Every developed nation is targeting negative real interest rates. Nearly every developed nation is maintaining historically unprecedented levels of debt. An office worker in Greece will spend the next twenty years paying for the disastrous mistakes of criminals. And what's the future for Japan, the US... ? You couldn't ask for a better moment for Bitcoin.

M-Pesa (M for mobile, pesa is Swahili for money) is a mobile phone-based money transfer, financing and microfinancing service, launched in 2007 by Vodafone for Safaricom and Vodacom, the largest mobile network operators in Kenya and Tanzania. It has since expanded to Afghanistan, South Africa, India and in 2014 to Romania and in 2015 to Albania. M-Pesa allows users to deposit, withdraw, transfer money and pay for goods and services (Lipa na M-Pesa) easily with a mobile device.

The service allows users to deposit money into an account stored on their cell phones, to send balances using PIN-secured SMS text messages to other users, including sellers of goods and services, and to redeem deposits for regular money.

History has shown that individuals who value financial freedom shouldn't trust centralised private banking, which uses debt-based monetary policies with a fractional reserve system. The groups that run the business of banking have too much power and influence. The 2007-2008 recession bailout showed that gains could be privatised while the losses were socialised, all without your consent.

He has a video on monetary history in 10 minutes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD3KYlpE2lk&amp;t=2s. 

Note that money has changed fundamentally several times in the past century. Also, the universally accepted reserve note (USD) has recently lost its dominance as the Petrodollar as of Mar 26/2018.

1543	rupertwolfemurray	One problem is solves is micro transactions. With BTC you can pay a few cents for something without transaction charges, and if you look at banks they charge a lot for this and often have a 30 cent minimum charge. So, the problem is, I want to pay 5 cents for reading an online article but the bank adds a 30 cent commission. BTC provides the solution. Also, even if BTC doesn't survive the blockchaine technology answers another critical problem of how to secure online transactions so it will end up being adopted by the mainstream. The short term distraction is that the users seem obsessed with share prices, the regulators with controlling it and the press with finding one-off stories of crime that help them portray it as some sort of criminal conspiracy.

2) You hold your own money and you decide whatever you want to do with your money.  Fiat currencies do not allow such.

3) Goverment's do collapse but most importantly they're corrupt. Bitcoin is not built to be the doomsday currency, but to mantain itself regardless of the economical or burocratic state of any country or institutions. That's another reason why Bitcoin can't be ""shut down""

4) yeah Bitcoin is slow, but have you tried making an international transfer with your bank? It takes days, in Bitcoin minutes. 2nd layer solutions such as lightning network were built for fast day to day transactions.

5) volatility is a problem, but it's not there by design. It's the effect the emerging ecosystem is having on the way we're perceiving this technology, because is that, people speculating how important Bitcoin is and will be for us as socities. As with any other market, volatility will diminish with adoption.

But your description also applies to 99.99% of all other crypto-currencies.  The truth is most of us got into Bitcoin based on historical gains and we wanted some of that.  The other's got into Bitcoin because they thought Bitcoin would change the world, replace major fiat currencies and some even thought it could stop wars.  None of which is true, it's not going to happen. 

No volatile crypto-currency based on a public blockchain will ever replace fiat currency.  Only a government issued crypto-currency, one that is designed to be price stable can/will take the place of a fiat notes. China and other countries are working on this right now.

Bitcoin is a store of value, a commodity and a currency, more so now with Lightning, but it will never permanently replace fiat currency, however it will/is useful as a temp solution in countries with hyper-inflation.  Bitcoin is relevant and has use cases, but replacing official fiat currencies is not one of them.

Just look at the purchasing power of usd since it came off the gold standard in the 70s. Look at the purchasing power of btc since 2009. If the trend continues it makes sense to invest a small amount in btc and see what happens in the long run. 

Practical use? I can send money with bitcoin to a family member in another country.. peer 2 peer. Didn't have to ask for permission. Didn't have to go through any banks.

Give a smart phone to a farmer in a 3rd world country. Now he has a bank account in his hand, and he can place an order online and get supplies shipped for his farm. He didn't have to use a bank that might have been corrupt or ask for permission.

Bitcoin was under attack last fall so transactions were slow. There have been a lot of changes since then, exchanges are batching and using segwit now. Try sending a transaction now and tell me how long it takes.
 
Bitcoin is faster than fiat. You can't argue against bitcoin traveling across the globe vs paper currency... sure the money shows up instantly in your account... but you realize that's credit right? There's a difference between available credit and current balance. The money still has to physically move from one account to another.... 

As a merchant I can use coinbase commerce to instantly convert btc into fiat when I receive it. No risk of volatility and I avoided the 2% fee (which could be like $2000 in savings depending on my credit sales).

The main takeaway here is the decentralized nature of the invention.  It is integral to bitcoin.  Bitcoin isnt a currency, or a commodity, it is a *technology*.  A *protocol*.


So you invent things to solve problems ?  Thats ok, but thats not why people invent things.  They invent things to make other things *better*, or to do things in a better way.  Not because there was a problem per se.  


So next time there are elections and people complain about irregularities and fraud and need recounts or even court battles - think about - how can we make it better ?


Well we can.  We use the bitcoin technology.  To *decentralize* the election process so no one person is in charge.  No fraud, no disputes, nothing.

1564	bitbug42	"I agree with you that the reason why bitcoin is interesting is not obvious today to the majority of people... but it was the same when the internet, or the computer or the phone first came out. 

It's radically different from what people are used to, so it may take some time to discover the benefits and adjust. And those that have enough foresight/done enough research to find out early before everyone else may be rewarded for their risk-taking (or punished if they are wrong).

About the benefits, like you mentioned there is the whole ""cypherpunk/decentralized"" argument that while appealing to those that care about decentralization, may fall on deaf ears for the mainstream public that just care about ""send X money from A to B"".

I asked myself the same question, but I found out some properties of bitcoin that may appeal to this latter mainstream group:

* in a BTC-world, there is no foreign exchange needed. Travel from Europe to America to Asia, and pay using the same currency. No mental-gymnastics to convert prices, no exchange fees, in short much less friction.

* speed of opening a new ""account"". A bitcoin wallet can be created in less than 1 second vs a bank account that takes weeks or months if you fit a profile that they don't particularly like (like student, no to few money, or from 3rd-world countries ...). The Coinbase case is not specific to Bitcoin, the long account opening process is specific to Coinbase, not Bitcoin itself. In a BTC-world, say you're just beginning in life, get your 1st contract, need to open a new wallet, 1 second later it's done, and you receive your salary in Bitcoin. For example: a few months ago, a friend of mine was struggling to open a bank account (student, no work experience, so not a customer banks tend to like), and the banks always replied to him with excuses about how something was missing from his paperwork and whatnot. He wasn't particularly convinced about bitcoin, but that was until a night, when he was on his computer struggling to triple-check everything was correct with his paperwork to open an account for the n-th time, and during the whole time I just ran a script on my computer creating/""opening"" a dozen bitcoin addresses per second, and it blew his mind. In this case, bitcoin would've been a solution to his problem.

* in a fiat-world, prices of basic items (like food, water, electricity, ...) tend to rise over time. People DO notice that and complain. If we denominated the prices of basics in BTC, prices would tend to slowly decrease at best or stay rather stable at worst (even assuming late-stage adoption with much less volatility and less upward movement than during the last years).

All these are things that the average-joe can understand without having a Ph.D in economics, like you don't need to be a mechanic to value automobiles.

But as I said, because we're still early-stage, these benefits aren't easily apparent just yet. Early-adopters discover them first by doing research and taking risks, they help bootstrap the innovation &amp; the ecosystem. And as it develops, the value slowly becomes obvious, and that's when we enter mainstream adoption.

1569	PuckFoloniex	"First of all bitcoin will never replace fiat, its a ridiculous idea imho. Best case is they will coexist and it will be an alternative asset class which is somewhere between gold and currency. Its like gold because its scarce, but way easier to spend and move.

Second, bitcoin is in its baby steps still, its a very new technology with problems waiting be solved (energy consumption, transaction speeds, scaling). Its not difficult to solve any of those, but you have to sacrifice decentralization or security (which is what altcoins are doing).

&gt; You might say, ""well, it's decentralized"". So what? What issue am I having with my ""centralized"" US dollar? None. Is the fear that the USD will collapse? I don't see that happening in my lifetime....but I have seen bitcoin collapse multiple times.

&gt;Ok, well I read an article about how bitcoin is taking off in Africa because their local currencies are very unstable and prone to hyper-inflation. This would make sense to me.....again, if bitcoin were stable, but it's not. It's down 22% over the past week. Wouldn't these people have had better luck converting their money into USD or gold?

Not everybody lives in US, good luck finding USD in Africa. And gold is very difficult to move and store.

&gt;So you might say, well it's anonymous (I'm not sure if that's even true). Again, ok, so what problem is that solving? Unless I'm doing something illegal, do I really care about this? No. The last peer to peer transaction I conducted was sending my sister $50 to reimburse her for a gift card. It doesn't need to be anonymous. I don't care if the whole world knows. I used facebook to send it. I've never sent money through facebook before and it literally took me 30 seconds with no fees.

In this case you are right, there is not much use of bitcoin, but try making an international payment of 50k USD. Its a nightmare. Again bitcoin cannot possibly replace fiat.

&gt;That brings me to my next point. Bitcoin is slow. Last week I decided to put my money where my mouth is and (attempt to) make a bitcoin purchase through Newegg. It was honestly kind of a pain in the ass. Once I had the wallet all set up, I went to coinbase to buy my bitcoin. Had to verify identity and bank account, which took a couple days and didn't feel very anonymous. Then I went to buy my bitcoin....oh, it's going to take a week before I can actually access my coins?? That's stupid. Guess what also happened in that week? Bitcoin went from $8700 to $6800. Awesome!

&gt;Then I went to send the money to my wallet. Ok, that also takes forever. While I was waiting for it to confirm, I started reading up on the delays. I saw that during the bitcoin rush, it could take days for transactions to confirm. Also, you can pay a higher fee to have your transaction confirm faster. Ok, that's stupid. Anyway, the whole process of getting set up to buy bitcoin was annoying and drawn out and again, for what benefit? I planned on making a purchase through Newegg. I could have just used my credit card and completed the purchase in seconds. Instead, I waited weeks and ultimately decided to wait in hopes that the value of bitcoin comes back up first. Fun.

Thats not bitcoins problem though, thats an issue with the exchange. Its also time consuming to open a bank account (maybe not in US, I don't know), but after you opened it its easy to use. My typical bitcoin payment takes around 1 minute (and 10 minutes to verify). You don't need to wait for verification for small goods, when someone sends you btc, you can check your wallet and see the funds instantly, if they have sent it with an acceptable fee its close to impossible to reverse the payment. (again you can wait 10~ minutes if you don't want to bother with it). Lightning network is starting to take off and its going to make payments even faster (close to instant).



Again your concerns are not completely baseless, volatility is very problematic, its could never replace fiat for most use cases. Bitcoin will not change the world of finance contrary to common delusion on this sub, its just a new asset class in its infancy.

1570	eqleriq	"You have to imagine a future where intermediaries don't profit from necessities of human existence, then crypto makes sense.

I want to exchange value to purchase things without someone getting a cut of it. It's really that simple.

Everything you're bringing up has to do with either the early, formative stages of any technology or the resistance to the ideal use-case by existing power structures. You could apply your logic and sentiment with any technology that is more efficient than a current technology, especially when that current technology is very profitable.


If you think that cutting down trees and using dying and printing technology to make ""paper tokens"" is superior or more efficient than digital tokens, then argument over.

Otherwise, you realize that a 100% digital system is more efficient.

Now, if you think that a digital system needs to be centralized and controlled by a for-profit entity, then argument over.

Otherwise, you realize that a 100% decentralized system is more efficient.


All your comments on valuation are pointless. People adhered to bitcoin when it was $0. You're not impressing anyone by lamenting that the volatility in an early price discovery phase that is 100% community driven is a ""bad thing."" 

If I shit on a piece of paper and people drive the price up to $20k for that piece of paper, then it falls to $6k ... your concern shouldn't be that ""it would be better if it stayed at $20k or increased."" It's arbitrary based on market demand, no matter what. 

What I believe -- and there is evidence that ""many"" believe -- is that bitcoin could be worth $0.01 and it would still be the necessary evolution of value exchange.

1571	chadsterlington	"Ok couple things - Aren't miners essentially intermediaries that are profiting from bitcoin transactions? You would have more of an argument here if there were no fees with bitcoin, but there are. In fiat, sure there is a merchant processing fee for credit card transactions, but no fees when using cash or check. Merchant processor or miner, what's the difference? Both getting a cut of the transaction. 

Next, I hear your argument that a digital token is more efficient than a paper token. I'm a bit of an environmentalist so I don't like the idea of clear cutting forests for paper. But a couple counterpoints - USD obviously doesn't have to used in a paper form. I very rarely use cash. Also, I don't know the exact numbers here, but doesn't the bitcoin network consume an absolutely insane amount of power? I wouldn't call that efficient either....

I'm not sure what your argument is for a decentralized system being more efficient? Also, if it is more efficient, does it come at the cost of stability? What's more important?

Lastly, i'm trying to look at bitcoin from a practical perspective because that's the only way people will ever adopt it, so valuation does matter. You are right, it's value is based on market demand, but it is far from arbitrary. Let's say you work for a hip new tech company and they pay you in bitcoin. Awesome! Your salary is X amount of bitcoin every year. Ok, well in December 2017 X amount of bitcoin would have bought you a lambo. Today, X amount of bitcoin will maybe buy you a Kia. Your salary hasn't changed, but your purchasing power has. In a way, you're right, valuation doesn't matter.....because nobody is actually using bitcoin! If it were actually being used a currency (which is what it's supposed to be right?) than valuation would absolutely matter. If you say that the value of a currency is arbitrary, then argument over.

1575	ebliever	"Let me get this straight. You would prefer to hold dollars that are subject to inflation and have lost 95%+ of their value in the last century, rather than invest in Bitcoin that has gone from zero to thousands of dollars in nine years.

Have I got that straight?

You are completely missing/glossing over the fatal flaw of government-issued currency. Politicians are always finding ways to spend money, and it is always easier to run a deficit than to raise taxes and anger someone today. So governments run up huge debts that become manageable only by printing excess money to create inflation, reducing the value of the debt they hold (and stiffing the people who are owed that money). 

Sooner or later this gets out of hand, and people realize they are never going to be repaid if they make loans to the government (or will lose on the deal due to inflation). That leads to a hyperinflationary death spiral. It's happened many times before and will keep happening because of the basic dynamic outlined above. Human nature is not going to suddenly change.

Decentralized cryptocurrency is free from this fatal flaw. There is no one who has power and is motivated to print extra bitcoins to cause inflation. All the other issues you mention pale in comparison to that simple point.

Yes there are bugs, and the LN is not ready for prime time yet, and payment systems are not mature and so forth. All that can and will be fixed. But that's secondary stuff in relation to the core value proposition for Bitcoin and related cryptocurrencies: They are scarce.

That's what this boils down to. Bitcoin is scarce, and it is secure. No government issued fiat can credibly say the same. And the next time we have a financial crisis and they run the printing presses the whole world will be reminded of it."	1522450806.0	2018-04-01 16:32:59.681099	dwj6h83	t3_88aqb2	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88aqb2/my_opinion_on_bitcoin_its_pointless/dwj6h83/	-3	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	-3
1576	chadsterlington	"I see your first point, but I think it's a little misleading. Essentially you're saying $1.00 today is worth 95% less than it was 100 years ago, because of inflation? I haven't verified that, but assuming it's true there are other factors at play. Sure, if you just put your money under your mattress for 100 years, you would get screwed. But most people put their money in an account that's going to have some sort of return. Even a savings account can get you 1.45% today. If you put your money in the S&amp;P it would have grown 14% over the past year, and that's at a much faster rate than inflation. 

I understand not everybody can afford to invest their money, but even wages are constantly increasing (albeit, not always at the same rate as inflation, which I do think is a problem). Basically my point is, sure a dollar went a long way in 1910, but the average salary was also $400/year. 

I do agree with you regarding government spending and the out-of-control deficit....but I still haven't quite grasped that bitcoin is a solution to that, in a practical sense. I'm not an expert in economics so maybe I just haven't connected the dots here.

1591	maulop	"The benefit of bitcoin is that it separates the value of money from controlling sources like governments, banks or other actors (even cryptominers). And distributes the payment processors, allowing anyone to be part of it, so the network becomes really strong if a lot of people take part in it.

One problem it solves is trust. You can't get fake bitcoins if they pass one verification. Bitcoin is not anonymous, it's private (very different concepts). Fiat and credit cards have been cloned countless of times.

Merchants have to pay a fee for every credit or debit card transaction, but they tend to manipulate prices to compensate for fees, depending on the contract they have with the payment processor they hired. For users those transactions are instantaneous, however in the back end, they take at least a day to settle, and involve insurance and other mechanisms to compensate for fraud. And in the end is the buyer who pays for taxes (if you have VAT) and fees.

And if merchants wants to accept bitcoin or other digital coins, they have to install a node to verify their own transactions, otherwise it's going to be slow, and by adding nodes they give more power to the network and help with the congestion problem.

In a developed country is hard to use bitcoin when the economy has well established financial and economic systems (banking access, payment systems and options, credit). However in poor or developing countries it gives you a lot of practical benefits when you don't have all those options. You can store your money and know that the goverment cannot affect the value of the currency, or the bank is going to charge you a ridiculous amount of money for maintenance fees or freeze your account for ""security"". Also you don't have to hide it under the matress or having a money vault with thousands of banknotes with a total value of $100

A very interesting example happened in my country a couple of days ago: (and it can happen in other countries if a coordinated attack or some weird accident happens) There's one operator controlling the credit card and debit card network (a monopoly); banks also use their systems to handle ATM transactions. Their main server went offline, and the backup server didn't started, so the whole payment network was down. No one could pay for stuff or get money from ATMs. Also the same morning, the network that handles the insurance for public and private healthcare was down, and people couldn't use their insurance to pay for a doctor. Hospitals and clinics offered patients to pay in full to be attended and then they could get a refund with their insurance, but since it's expensive, some people went home and others waited until the problem got solved. With decentralized systems this scenario can't happen unless you destroy every access point to that network, or block internet access for the whole country."	1522475768.0	2018-04-01 16:32:59.681598	dwjvrec	t3_88aqb2	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88aqb2/my_opinion_on_bitcoin_its_pointless/dwjvrec/	0	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	0

1594	CadmeusCain	"Me personally? Only a couple a year. Not too many. 

The company I work for: all the time in international business. Possibly weekly. 

My family/friends who have relatives in India or parts of Africa, monthly.

Really depends person to person. I think the availability of the technology also warps behaviour. So in the days of the post: people sent overseas letters infrequently (maybe once a month if you have a penpal). With email I send multiple overseas e-mails a day (sometimes as many as 50 a week). I wouldn't send this many if it cost as much as the post.

One way to see this is as an enabling technology. How often will it be used? Let people use and let's see. "	1522535950.0	2018-04-01 16:32:59.681598	dwkx4lg	t1_dwkwady	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88aqb2/my_opinion_on_bitcoin_its_pointless/dwkx4lg/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

That's not true (for the public-key part anyhow).  Shor's algorithm runs in polynomial time, vs exponential time for brute-forcing the key, and on a practical and sufficiently fast quantum computer could effectively break bitcoin's public-key crypto.  According to IBM, for the largest integer factorization that's been done, a quantum machine could do it in something like 10000000000000000000x fewer operations.

1766	bmfd_	I think it has similarities with a gambling addiction. The thrive of making a good trade, getting irritated when a trade doesn't turn out as expected. Having the feeling that you're missing out on lots of opportunities when you decide not to trade. Having the urge to frequently check the prices to see if everything is going according to plan etc. At least, that was my experience for a while. Luckily I became aware of the fact that it was affecting me too much and I decided to spend allot less time on trading and checking prcies. 	1522465528.0	2018-04-01 16:32:59.700599	dwjlxig	t3_88cqba	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88cqba/is_addiction_to_bitcoin_like_gambling_addiction/dwjlxig/	5	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	5

1771	rupertwolfemurray	That's a very interesting comment. Heavy drinkers often ask me if they're an alcoholic and I turn to the AA-type view which is that if the passion controls your life then it's an addiction. And an addiction is invariably negative. The other feature of addiction is that addicts invariably deny they have it, and become very defensive and very good at justifying their actions (and intentions). 	1522469761.0	2018-04-01 16:32:59.700599	dwjq4xk	t1_dwjo11z	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88cqba/is_addiction_to_bitcoin_like_gambling_addiction/dwjq4xk/	3	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	3

Income tax in my opinion is an unjust theft of wages someone's forced to earn in order to exist in the economy.

1842	coogie	"I knew a guy who used to sell VHS tapes at a flea market which catered mostly to a particular ethnicity every weekend. He had used movies and such but a lot of the tapes were music videos of popular singers, sports, and things that was hard to find at blockbuster. He started by just having a single table but after a couple of years, had two whole spaces, TV's setup with the music videos playing, etc. and was doing pretty well.  

Business started going down enough to where it wasn't really worth his while to spend his weekends there. DVDs were becoming popular, broadband was starting to be available, and so he got a storage unit and packed his things in there.  

A couple of other guys who sold videos offered to buy his tapes but he thought he was getting low-balled.  These were hard to find tapes after all. He had spent a lot of time finding suppliers and catalogs.  It was just a matter of time before they would become classics.  

A couple of years later, that didn't happen.  He was still paying to keep them in storage, and even then he had a chance to just sell them at a loss and move on, but he refused because he was already so invested and he'd feel stupid if he just gave up now. 

I don't know how long he had them in storage but eventually he got them out and kind of kept them in the warehouse of a shop he owned while they baked in the heat and humidity of the summer and damp winters.  He finally accepted it was stupid to keep it and put them all in a dumpster last year. 

If he could have a do-over, I bet he would have sold the damn things while he could break even or lose 20%.  "	1522463833.0	2018-04-01 16:32:59.709600	dwjk77p	t3_88cf87	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88cf87/i_dont_care_if_it_reaches_0/dwjk77p/	14	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	14

If he already made a bit of money out of selling VHS tapes until DVDs started coming out he probably thought that particular stash of VHS tapes was worth losing. While his VHS business was going downhill he might've had something on the side. The more things you have on the side the less you care whether one particular thing goes to shit. If it's worthless you throw it away and move on focusing on the other ones.	1522467039.0	2018-04-01 16:32:59.710101	dwjnfyr	t1_dwjk77p	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88cf87/i_dont_care_if_it_reaches_0/dwjnfyr/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

Saving for the future is also a gamble since I might die before I have time to enjoy my savings. Still, I'd gladly take that gamble, aware of the risks and potential benefits involved.

At the end of the day, people will continue to project months and years ahead to the best of their abilities, trusting their judgement and risk-vs-gains analysis in face of all the countless possibilities that could thwart their hopes and effort. There will be those that lose what they risked and those that gained from their risks.

Very simply people will mine if it is profitable.  Those whose electricity price is too high will drop out.  The amount of mining follows the bitcoin price, not the other way around.

If bitcoin gradually fell to $100 over the next year, the miners with the most expensive electricity would stop mining. The difficulty would then fall until only the last miners with the cheapest electricity would be left mining.

1905	igadjeed	"&gt; Didn't Satoshi say that BTC's intrinsic value are the electricity costs necessary for PoW?

Definitely not  

Mining costs follow the price down  
Lower price -&gt; lower profits -&gt; fewer miners -&gt; lower difficulty -&gt; lower mining costs  

The ""lower difficulty"" part is automatic, built-in to the Bitcoin software. This automatic adjustment means that the mining cost does not create a price floor for Bitcoin  
The price can go all the way down to a fraction of a cent, and mining would continue to produce one Bitcoin block every 10 minutes"	1522531507.0	2018-04-01 16:32:59.830101	dwktwco	t3_88hdrw	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88hdrw/current_mining_costs_intrinsic_value_of_btc/dwktwco/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

Are losing theirs and blaming it on you; 
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubting too:
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated don't give way to hating,
And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise; 

If you can dream- -and not make dreams your master; 
If you can think- -and not make thoughts your aim,
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same:.
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
And stoop and build'em up with worn-out tools; 

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings,
And never breathe a word about your loss:
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on! '

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
Or walk with Kings- -nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
If all men count with you, but none too much:
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
And- -which is more- -you'll be a Man, my son! "	1522456004.0	2018-04-01 16:32:59.842599	dwjbxag	t1_dwiw0nv	/r/Bitcoin/comments/8895vr/bitcoin_breaks_below_7k_to_fall_to_50_day_low/dwjbxag/	2	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	2

2209	Allways_Wrong	"As much as I’ve calculated solo mining has higher ...er, returns than playing lotto. 

You can calculate pretty quick by dividing total hashrate by your hashrate, and there are your odds for 12.5btc, plus tx fees, every ~10 minutes. 

There are 1,000 blocks mined per week, and I guess you might play 10 games of lotto a week. 

You’ll get tripped up in all the zeros so perhaps calculate using those thingamajigs they have a name for like this: 2 x 10^3, which is 2 with 3 zeroes, or 3,000 (or 3.000, or 3’000, or 3K). See; tripped up in zeros.

An ASIC miner is basically a processing unit that was created only for one specific thing like calculating hashes and mining bitcoin and can't do anything else, therefore its made to be much more efficient at that thing than anything else. 	1522369752.0	2018-04-01 16:32:59.867599	dwhcrij	t1_dwhcg4c	/r/Bitcoin/comments/881653/chill_out_that_guy_who_doesnt_understand_bitcoin/dwhcrij/	10	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	10

He was picturing me in his head building some sort of drilling rig and heading into the mountains to dig up these coins or maybe metal that I would use to mint coins. The next day we went to a hockey game and when it came up in conversation I realized the miscommunication and explained the whole thing to him in detail.... Well I explained it after I finished laughing uncontrollably for a couple of minutes. Not that he's stupid or that I was laughing AT him, it was just so fucking hilarious 😂. 	1522415809.0	2018-04-01 16:32:59.868100	dwimma0	t3_881653	/r/Bitcoin/comments/881653/chill_out_that_guy_who_doesnt_understand_bitcoin/dwimma0/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

Just felt nicer and better to give her a whole coin of something rather than something that looks meager. They are same value technically but mentally a mile apart. For most ppl who have not bought crypto yet, they will have similar mental barrier.

All things equal, if no coins are bought and sold, and the market need only absorb newly mined coins, then $7,000 x 1800 = $12.6m of fiat needs to be injected daily to just maintain the price.

This equates to $88m new fiat every week, and $4.6bn/yr.

To extend this logic to a $20k bitcoin, you're looking at $36m/day, $252m/wk, or $13.1b/year

Let's be conservative and say that there are 100,000 people who religiously save in BTC by buying a little bit every week. For you to have your sustainable $20k/btc, you will need each of these 100,000 people to invest an average of $2,520 per week.

Again, the point of BTC is to destroy government and banking hegemony. People need to be buying weekly and holding, otherwise, the price has nowhere to go but down.

(EDIT: Despite there being 750k+ users on this subreddit, I'd say 740k of them have a net worth lower than the required weekly maintenance investment)"	1522518172.0	2018-04-01 16:32:59.875606	dwknkan	t3_88fry2	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88fry2/long_term_are_you_really_worried_well_never/dwknkan/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

Bitcoin is a great investment because it is scarce. Also with LN you could make instant payments. And thats all. And it has the first mover advantage. 

Anyone can make their own blockchain if they want to. Anyone can invent something better than blockchain too.

So? And as for reasons stated before I'm bullish on Btc. 

Also whoever thinks we will get quickly rich is mistaken. Surely if you win a lottery ticket with some random shitcoin going up like hell then yeah.

Bitcoin is SCARCE and it has a value till the day its unhackable. When it gets hacked its worthless. Just like your bank account. 

And comparing kid drawings with Bitcoin is laughable. 

As for now Bitcoin is a speculation, we speculate that a lot of people would invest in it in order to drive the price up and you can make almost instantaneous payments with it for peanuts. 

Also all alt coins are tied up to it (which I dislike). Everything should be traded against $,€ but that brings a lot of bureaucracy. With time and new regulations we could see clean and tidy market.

Also, I wasn’t comparing bitcoin with childhood drawings. I was using childhood drawings an example to illustrate that scarcity isn’t a source of value. I agree it amplifies value though.

2320	wunderbaah	No, that is the only quilt store in town BUT the second largest grocery store is now accepting LN, and I talked to three coffee shops today who seemed VERY interested when I explained the advantages (and did a little red pilling about fiat while I was at it). They use Square right now but I explained about Twitter banning crypto ads (and how the president of both companies is banning crypto ads so he can start his own currency without competition). Long story short, they are ditching square and moving to 100% LN (and even discouraging fiat!).	1522506041.0	2018-04-01 16:32:59.888099	dwkijo5	t1_dwki3t6	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88996s/daily_discussion_march_30_2018/dwkijo5/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

2414	wunderbaah	Yes CNBC and others monitor reddit for investor sentiment. If they see false lies and FUD spread by trolls they will think that bitcoin is not a good investment. The BIG money listens to this subreddit since we are the tastemakers for the entire crypto community. This is why policing our content is so important. If any false FUD or lies enter into the discussion than we are not putting our best foot forward to the community and therefore Wall Street and the big investor types who watch CNBC and other networks. If anyone has contacts with The Wall Street Journal please let me know because I am compiling a list of positive reddit comments to send to them. Hopefully they will publish them in an article about bitcoin and crypto currencies since they are one of the largest financial newspapers that old dinosaur stock market types read hoping to get the scoop in the next big investment to park their millions of dollars. This is especially true after the DOW markets and NASDACK have dramatically CRASHED this week and cryptos have traditionally been considered a safe investment haven by the large players. This is just the first of many cracks showing in the facade that is the SCAM FIAT markets and will soon come tumbling down as crypto is shown again and again and again to be the future of the world economies. I will say that since fiat is MATHEMATICALY PROVEN TO BE WORTHLESS, all of the so called “super power economies” (US, Canada, Russia, and China) are in fact worthless since they are run entirely on FIAT. The first economy to be 100% crypto will be the worlds first HYPERPOWER economy since it has intrinsic value based on immutability, trustless decentralization, and MATH. My recommendation would be to setup large government funded mining operations for bitcoin and buy power from neighboring countries with FIAT (it’s worthless so let them have it while we use it to create bitcoin and other cryptos). This is the way forward. This is the FUTURE. If you don’t agree then take your FUD and LEAVE!	1522489581.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.026599	dwk77lo	t1_dwk6l3n	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88996s/daily_discussion_march_30_2018/dwk77lo/	-2	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	-2

Bitcoin does not gain value because a lot of energy is used to run the network.

It doesn't actually. The reason a lot of electricity is currently being used is that the difficulty adjusts to keep the average block time at 10 minutes. So if there are more miners, there won't be more Bitcoins. So miners must compete to get the block rewards that are only ""given"" once every 10 minutes. If the price goes down, fewer miners will join the competition and less electricity will be used while the block time and reward stay the same."	1522469022.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.030103	dwjpege	t3_88d7am	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88d7am/btc_price_going_down_i_disagree_with_whats/dwjpege/	5	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	5

Nothing is as important as the ability to withstand attack. That is what security is. Transaction speed, privacy, ease of use... all of these qualities are worthless if you cant trust the system. TRUST comes from immutability. Immutability comes from time tested, open source, code with money at stake and HASH RATE on a purely proof of work public blockchain.

It has continued to grow it's computing power even after becoming the most powerful computing force on the planet.... by far.... That's why people have bought into it. And that's why they continue.

Not really. I know that it has uses outside of speculative investing, but I have no reason to believe that a correct valuation of those uses would peg bitcoin at anywhere north of $2000. Personally, I don't value bitcoin at more than $1000, but I concede that I could be wrong.

2550	ArmoredSheep	"Here are two similar definitions of a bubble: 

#1 Investopedia.com: A bubble is an economic cycle characterized by rapid escalation of asset prices followed by a contraction. It is created by a surge in asset prices unwarranted by the fundamentals of the asset and driven by exuberant market behavior. When no more investors are willing to buy at the elevated price, a massive selloff occurs, causing the bubble to deflate.

#2 Wikipedia: An economic bubble or asset bubble (sometimes also referred to as a speculative bubble, a market bubble, a price bubble, a financial bubble, a speculative mania, or a balloon) is trade in an asset at a price or price range that strongly exceeds the asset's intrinsic value.

Bubble like behavior has been portrayed, in the market as a whole and in the price of Bitcoin. But I would say Bitcoin is not a bubble, based on these two definitions, because much of the hype is based on fundamental value, which I stated before is a system that offers trust and security by utilizing time tested code and an unrivaled amount of computing power. Volatility does not = bubble. But more importantly, nowhere in anyones definition of bubble does it say that the asset or market is doomed. So to call Bitcoin a bubble is extremely vague. How long before it bursts? After it bursts, is it gone for good or will it start a new growth cycle? How long will the next growth cycle be and how high will the price go? What is the actual intrinsic value of Bitcoin anyway?.......... Only time will tell. To call it a bubble and bet against it is just as much a speculation as the alternative-maybe even more, because so far the track record has been growth and more growth and it spreads like a virus and it survives like a Tardigrade."	1522545379.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.047099	dwl5axi	t1_dwl0t1p	/r/Bitcoin/comments/884owh/bitcoin_is_stronger_now_than_it_was_when_it_was/dwl5axi/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

You also don't seem to understand what a logical fallacy is, since none of those things you listed are.

\#1: Not an argument I'd use.  I believe the fiat exchange value will go up again because of the basic mathematics involved, not just because it did so in the past.

\#2: I don't see how these are greatly contradictory statements other than that the fiat exchange value is pretty much irrelevant.  A better way to phrase the second part would be ""don't regret not getting bitcoin when it becomes the only way to freely transact"" (which would likely coincide with a large fiat exchange value).

\#3: Without an example, I have no idea what you're talking about.

\#4: I think the people doing this are a very different group of people to those interested in the tech.

\#5: I have no idea what this even means.

\#6: Again, I don't see these as being greatly contradictory.  Fiat is bad.  When the fiat exchange value goes down, it is a sign of adoption taking longer.  I'd prefer adoption to happen more quickly.  Therefore I do care (to some extent) about the value going down.

2619	dalebewan	"I should have said ""basic mathematics combined with social evaluation"", since I don't believe that mathematics alone is sufficient to explain anything at all in the universe without a contextual environment that it is describing.

It's possible that my social evaluation is incorrect, however I don't believe so.

1. There will only ever be 21x10^6 BTC in existence.

2. There are around 7.6x10^9 people in the world.

3. The majority of people do not currently own any BTC.

4. Bitcoin is useful (immutable, uncensorable transfer of value).

5. Some percentage of the people in the world will either require or desire at least one of the use cases that Bitcoin has.

6. The number of people requiring or desiring it will fluctuate as power structures around the world fluctuate, however the current direction of most of the world (increase in authoritarianism and control over populations) points to a greater need for Bitcoin's use cases.

7. Bitcoin will become easier to use over time as more applications are created for interacting with it.  This is generally true of any software system, but can also be seen to be true historically thus far.

8. As Bitcoin becomes easier to use, more people that have a requirement/desire to use it who did not do so previously will begin do so.

9. Bitcoin mining costs time and energy, which can be directly represented as a cost in currency terms.

10. Bitcoin miners will not mine at a loss (i.e. should the cost of mining 1 BTC be greater than 1 BTC with no alterations possible to improve this, they will choose to cease operations).

11. Bitcoin miners who choose to exchange their bitcoin for fiat will do so at the highest possible exchange rates.

12. When bitcoin miners cease mining (decrease of hash power on the network), difficulty adjustment will occur and bitcoin mining will become easier (lower energy costs per bitcoin mined).  This must reach an equilibrium at a point, ensuring that some mining will always occur.

13. As long as some mining occurs (energy is expended), and there is a use for Bitcoin (which there is), it must continue to hold a value.

14. Bitcoins can be lost/destroyed permanently from the ecosystem (e.g. I once deleted around 200BTC back in the CPU mining days when I got worried about it damaging my system).

15. The less bitcoin that exist, the more each individual unit is worth due to the limited supply (point 1) as long as they continue to hold a value (point 13).

16. The value of fiat currencies decreases over time due to inflation.

17. Therefore according to points 15 and 16, over time the exchange rate between BTC and fiat currencies must increase in BTC's favour.

Now, all of that is pretty uncontroversial really.  The easy argument that I can imagine being made is that there's nothing in the above that stops it ""crashing"" down to a tiny value and then only increasing marginally over time, essentially remaining nearly worthless.  I don't disagree that this is a possibility.  However due to the usefulness (point 4) and the direction global politics is headed (point 6), I think it's extremely unlikely.

Not only do I think it is extremely unlikely, it's also not something that would really bother me significantly because it wouldn't alter my ability to *use* bitcoin which is what I care about.  I'm not here to get rich, I'm here to have a decentralised, immutable, uncensorable system of money.  As stated, I am interested in adoption, because that increases the cases where I can use it, which is good.  The fiat exchange rate is just an indicator of adoption from my perspective."	1522435630.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.050101	dwivnps	t1_dwiuqfz	/r/Bitcoin/comments/884owh/bitcoin_is_stronger_now_than_it_was_when_it_was/dwivnps/	2	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	2
2620	MichDC_	"Your social evaluation basically boils down to the assumption of Bitcoin mass adoption which is very unlikely. Yes, we will probably see a slow integration of the technology into our monetary system, currencies will adapt and governments will create their own. There is no solid reason to believe Bitcoin will conquer all.

Also, your mathematics don't make sense at all. The market price is determined by demand and supply, but the fact that Bitcoin has a limited supply has no direct impact at all. Not even indirectly, since everything in this world is considered scarce. Bitcoin is no exception. When we talk about supply and demand, we talk about the amount of BTC (expressed in dollars) people are willing to sell versus the amount of BTC people are willing to buy. If no-one is willing to buy a unit above (or on) the market price at a given platform, sellers will be forced to set a price below the market price, which will cause it to decrease. That is the only mathematics that matter, and the fact that there's a limited total supply does not come into play at all. You (and many others) are just gambling on the fact that demand will always outweigh supply in the long run. However, there are no valid indications that this is going to be the case. 

Of course, you're free to believe in yourself, but sometimes it feels as if 99% don't even know the basic power play between demand and supply, yet they can foresee the future.

Correct, but totally missing the point.  Supply and demand are inherently unevenly changing when one side of the equation has the potential for unlimited supply while the other does not.  Bitcoin's limited supply is *very much* the point here."	1522440454.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.050598	dwiy35f	t1_dwixpbj	/r/Bitcoin/comments/884owh/bitcoin_is_stronger_now_than_it_was_when_it_was/dwiy35f/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1
2622	MichDC_	"By that definition of scarcity, nothing would be scarce. Bread wouldn't be scarce because bakers can produce them at will. Ignoring the fact that resources to print fiat currencies and produce bread is limited, it is the fact that we (the ordinary citizens) don't have unlimited access to fiat currencies and bread, that makes them scarce by definition. 

And, as I said before, it is the willingness to buy and sell that determines the price. Bitcoin's limited supply would only be of importance in case demand can keep up, which takes your social evaluation into account to determine if this is a likely possibility in the future. It is here, however, that most people will disagree with each other.

Fiat currency and bread are two totally different things in that scenario though.  When I make a new loaf of bread, it doesn't make every other loaf of bread become less nutritious.  When the government prints a new dollar, it does make every other dollar worth less.

Aside from that, your definition of scarcity is far too subjective to be useful.  It depends entirely on the perception and situation of the individual rather than being a macro term that can be used to examine the broader situation.

&gt; Bitcoin's limited supply would only be of importance in case demand can keep up

I completely agree.

&gt; It is here, however, that most people will disagree with each other.

I don't think they disagree on this point because - from what I've seen - I don't think most people have thought it through that far to be honest.  They haven't actually stopped to think about what a limited supply actually implies.

If they have thought it through and they think that demand will be so low as to have fiat valuations similar to today (or even the previous all time high) then yes, we disagree quite strongly and I'd say that their perception of the potential future demand is probably based on some very faulty reasoning."	1522442499.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.050598	dwize0u	t1_dwiyri2	/r/Bitcoin/comments/884owh/bitcoin_is_stronger_now_than_it_was_when_it_was/dwize0u/	2	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	2

People buying and hoarding bitcoins just for the prospect of selling at a higher value in the future is also as harmful and only contributes to the pricing instability. 

Bitcoin has little long term value being collected hoarded, but has most value when used as a currency to trade for goods and services. Instead it just has imaginary value that carries no weight or stability because it isn't grounded on anything to spend on like land/property, wages etc. It's imaginary value can double when anyone pumps millions on an exchange, and drop by half when someone dumps millions of coins for sale. That needs to change else less people will stop believing in the imaginary value and it will fizzle away like it never existed.

We actually don't need to speculate on this question: they already do this today: while it is not illegal, many major companies will outright refuse to provide service to people in the pornography industry.

In a cashless future, without peer-to-peer currency, giant banks and companies will have arbitrary control over your ability to make legal transactions and make a living. They have already demonstrated they will exercise those powers.

The market has been downtrending for months. Just because you sell at a loss doesn’t mean you don’t believe in bitcoin.  The downtrend is continuing with no evidence of a breakout any time soon. If you sold at 8 or 9k, and you buy back in at 6k, when we do make it back to 9k, your not even, your at a profit. Using a strategy like this you can accumulate more btc for the long run.


Knowing when to cut your losses is being responsible with your money.

GNTB accepts cryptocurrencies as a means of payment
Frankfurt, 5 March 2018 - Effective immediately, services and services can be provided by the German National Tourist Board (GNTB) in cryptocurrencies, e.g. in Bitcoin, to be paid. The GNTB would like to test the crypto-currency underlying blockchain technology in its financial system and, if necessary, use it in the medium term in international payments.
Petra Hedorfer, Chair of the Board of the GNTB, explains: ""As part of our digitization strategy, we are constantly reviewing the latest technologies and trends for their applicability in our company. With the acceptance of crypto currencies as a means of payment and the potential medium-term implementation of blockchain technology in our finance business, we want to set an example as a global player as a driver of innovation and a catalyst for the tourism industry. ""
The blockchain technology offers interesting perspectives in terms of speed, transparency and security. Experts see enormous potential for improvement and savings, i.a. in international transactions."	1522420860.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.081602	dwipez1	t3_885p87	/r/Bitcoin/comments/885p87/germany_joins_russia_to_accept_bitcoin_as_a_mode/dwipez1/	7	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	7

https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/gaming/how-to-overclock.html

The unlocked Intel Core i9 processors mentioned in the article are vulnerable to both Meltdown and Spectre bugs, so in theory you could compensate those but like the article/advertisement says...

... functionality won't necessarily be ""normal""
... additional hardware (like cooling and power supply) might be needed
.... it will shorten the lifespan of the cpu and other components.

Furthermore, I'm not sure if Intel has offered security patches to i9s yet. If that's the case, the compensation wouldn't be possible of-course (while there's nothing to compensate)."	1522434654.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.191097	dwiv8f2	t1_dwim6q0	/r/Bitcoin/comments/885ylq/intel_wants_to_patent_a_bitcoin_mining_hardware/dwiv8f2/	3	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	3

2921	bellw0od	"You have fundamentally misunderstood the problem.

First off, it isn't remotely clear that Bitcoin is a true deflationary currency. Deflation isn't synonymous with appreciation. When fiat currencies become more valuable relative to other fiat currencies, we generally do not refer to that as ""deflation."" No respectable economist would describe the stock market as ""deflationary"" just because stocks tend on average to increase in value.

Bitcoin also isn't deflationary in the sense that its supply is fixed or decreasing. On the contrary, the circulating supply of Bitcoin increases every ten minutes, and will continue to do so for approximately the next 120 years. So I'm not sure why people in the crypto community insist on characterizing Bitcoin as a ""deflationary"" asset.

But all of that is ultimately beside the point, because ""deflation"" refers to something that can happen to a *currency.* It is completely unrelated to the normal appreciation that is always expected of an *investment.* Furthermore, it's a problem for the economy as a whole, not necessarily for the person who owns the deflating asset. It disincentivizes investment, which leads to the misallocation (i.e. ""hoarding"") of capital.

The stock market does literally the opposite of that. It's meant to reward people for putting their money to work. Speculating on the future price of a digital asset with no intrinsic value does not count as putting your money to work. It does nothing to strengthen the wider economy. To the extent that it drags down the spending power of people who would otherwise be demanding productive economic activity, it directly *harms* the economy--which is ultimately a bad thing for everyone.

Here's another way of looking at this: even if Bitcoin has been good to you personally, consider the fact that the person who bought your Bitcoin might have otherwise spent that money on shares of stock in a company that actually makes something. Is it really better for *you* to have that money, because you bought some Bitcoin when it was cheaper and successfully sat on it for a while?"	1522491773.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.196099	dwk8yf7	t1_dwj5z9n	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88agbw/deflationary_currencies_beat_inflationary/dwk8yf7/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

My original point is that people have a very bad habit of spending their money on things they don't need instead of investing it. Given this habit, it seems unlikely that they would stop spending money just because the buying power of their money is increasing slightly over time.
It seems more likely that deflationary spirals are caused by fear of economic collapse rather than the hope that prices will continue to fall and allow purchasing more goods later."	1522532256.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.196099	dwkuek0	t1_dwk8yf7	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88agbw/deflationary_currencies_beat_inflationary/dwkuek0/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1
2923	bellw0od	"&gt;I've always thought deflation meant ""an increase in buying power""

It's a bit strange to talk about Bitcoin's ""buying power."" At this stage, Bitcoin is a currency only in the most notional sense of the word. It can't really be used to buy anything. Exceptions are inevitably *priced* in USD or some other fiat currency, because that is the information that both parties to the transaction actually care about.

Think of it this way: if you owned a classic car that increased in value, would you refer to that as ""deflation"" and say that the car's ""buying power"" had increased?

Also, deflation is generally caused by a contraction of the money supply. In fact, [some sources](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deflation.asp) explicitly define deflation as an increase in purchasing power with that specific cause. Bitcoin's value is increasing for very different reasons--widespread speculation and a massive pool of untapped potential demand. If it ever achieves full mainstream adoption and becomes widely used as an actual currency, the situation will be very different. As I've already pointed out, the circulating supply of Bitcoin is actually constantly *increasing,* which would normally lead to a slow and steady rate of inflation.

&gt;My original point is that people have a very bad habit of spending their money on things they don't need instead of investing it.

Spending your money on crypto is not the same thing as investing it. Invested capital is ostensibly put to productive use in the economy. The same is true of money you put in a savings account--the bank lends it out or invests it. Buying a bunch of Bitcoin and ""hodling"" it on a Ledger Nano S is not the same thing. Money hoarding on a large scale would be terrible for the economy."	1522545969.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.196099	dwl5u3m	t1_dwkuek0	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88agbw/deflationary_currencies_beat_inflationary/dwl5u3m/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1
2924	SatoshisDog	"&gt; would you refer to that as ""deflation"" and say that the car's ""buying power"" had increased?

I would do an inflation adjustment to see if I had actually made money or not. I do that with all my investments. I would phrase it as ""appreciation"" though. 
&gt; the circulating supply of Bitcoin is actually constantly increasing, which would normally lead to a slow and steady rate of inflation.

Technically, the rate of inflation would decrease over time as the newly minted coins would be a smaller percentage of the total supply every time. And then every four years it will be cut in half. That's just a nitpick though. Fair point unless people hoard more and more Bitcoin or lose it at a higher rate than inflation.
&gt; Spending your money on crypto is not the same thing as investing it.

Do you consider precious metals, bottles of wine and other commodities to not be investments? What about real estate -- assuming that it sits empty instead of being rented out or used.
&gt; Money hoarding on a large scale would be terrible for the economy.

I'm getting out of my depth here, but aren't there economists who disagree with that in the Austrian school of economics?

Almost every time someone talks about how deflationary currencies aren't sustainable they point out deflationary events in fiat currencies as if it would be at all related. There's an enormous difference between a normally monetarily inflationary currency that is suddenly and surprisingly rising in price even as more continues to be printed, and a currency that has a 100% predictable amount of monetary inflation with a hard cap rising expectedly in value over time. 

Imagine your currency is monetarily inflating at 2% in an investment environment with a *negative* average ROI of -2%. In such an environment, even if you couldn't predict the currency will rise in value, you would choose to hold your currency (and lose 2%) rather than invest in a losing venture (since the additional risk has a cost as well). In such an environment, it's no surprise that the currency's value goes up as people want it over normal investments. But this is indicative of an economic shit hole, not a normal economy with a positive average rate of return. The problem in such a situation is that the economy is losing money and therefore it contracts. But of course a losing and contracting economy is unsustainable. The price rise of the currency is the effect, not the cause. And without exception these events occur with a currency that is monetarily *inflating*.

This question annoys me and I see it more of how an idiot imagines an economy works but certainly does not align with how people behave with money. 

First, people can TODAY take their money and invest it in risk-free assets that will increase their purchasing power allowing them to buy more later.  It is as if these morons think that one little intermediate step is preventing people from stopping all buying.  It makes no sense.

Secondly, time is deflationary.  Given the choice of buying 1 million hookers when I turn 70 or 1-2 a week *now*, I am going to chose the latter option because I am willing to sacrifice buying some buying power to get what I want now rather than having to wait.

YES, this is also true.  If you have a valuable money, people are going to want to work harder to earn more if it.

This incentivizes corporations to market their products in a way that makes consumers want them now, this minute. This consumerism has the positive effect of generating “growth” by forcing the companies to become bigger and employ more people to keep giving consumers what they are made to want. 

However, this system is all backed by debt... on every level. People spend money they don’t yet have. This creates a snowball effect of debt which ultimately leads to financial bubbles and crisis which the taxpayer has to pay through government bailouts.

2949	ImReallyHuman	"The fee is 31 cents but whatever, it all depends on how many inputs and outputs, if you're sending that transaction with segwit or not. If you would have sent 127 BTC with just 2 inputs and 2 outputs the fee would have only been 11 cents or less.

In either case that tx paid just 2.2 sat per byte, which is really low.

One thing that is annoying is that all the online bitcoin fee estimation websites do not tell you what the fee would be if you used segwit. 

Example https://estimatefee.com/ tells you what the recommend fee is WITHOUT segwit only. A segwit tx would be a third to a half the fee cost. A transaction with a lot of inputs WITH segwit could easily be half the fee cost in comparison to sending the same transaction without segwit. So if estimatefee.com's website had a check box ""sending with segwit"" and adjust the recommended fee accordingly, it would add a lot of awareness to segwit to every day users.

Beyond that, there are other options such as sidechains or altcoins (where you can trade security for convenience).  Your coffee example is analogous to going to the bank and paying for an automated clearing house transfer ($30 at my bank), showing ID, filling out and signing a couple documents, then waiting three days for it to clear.  Sure, you could pay for your coffee like that if you want, but there are much better options readily available.

This coffee costs 1mBTC, so send us 1mBTC with a fee of at least 10sat/byte and we'll give you the coffee.)
 this way the store can serve the customer nearly instantly, and because they have a minimum fee level, they know that the transaction will go through sometime soon.

2995	GopherFawkes	You're comparing percentages, I'm comparing whole dollar amounts. When hopefully my portfolio is 1mil or more around retirement age, if the stock market drops 1.5%(which happens from time to time during a trading session) that's 15k. So losing 15k now sucks but when it's out of a million it sucks a little less, so that's how I am coping with current losses.	1522393321.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.206099	dwi2ukp	t1_dwi0pri	/r/Bitcoin/comments/8828f9/me_looking_at_my_what_is_left_in_my_portfolio/dwi2ukp/	2	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	2

Hodl means don't trade your btc for fiat, don't panic sell from price fluctuations. It doesn't mean don't trade/ spend btc then replace it for fiat.

Hodl means use btc like a credit card. Have the fiat cash to make the purchases you want, if you can make the purchase with btc, make it and buy the btc back with the cash you had on hand. Your overall btc holdings are still the same, that's the point of hodl, not to put all your btc in a hardware wallet, locked in a safe, never to be transferred to anyone else again.

For both the user and merchant, all they need is the software for a payment to be made.

Compare with popular payment methods today which require credit cards, bank accounts, merchant accounts, payment processors, etc. Each of which have their own application and verification process producing valuable artifacts: prime targets for hacks and leaks.

Good to know my success rate has increased so dramatically from 99% failure. I do believe you're quoting success rates of new traders and people betting on margin though. I wound recommend you put some money aside and actually try your hand at anything but hodl memes. I know reddit is trying to convince you to keep the price high for them my not selling ever, but maybe you actually like keeping your money? 

I do not understand your problem. If you have 1 bitcoin you bought at 8k, and sold it at 7600, you have 7600 usd. When the price then hits 6700 and stabilizes, you can then buy 1.1343 bitcoin with that money. Once the price returns to 7600, the point where you sold, you will be holding $8620 usd in value. Or $9047 when it goes back to 8k. I don't know how your brain convinces you this is a loss of 5%. 

Only if you fail horribly by panic selling at the wrong time and the price ends up going up immediately after you sell do you lose that 5%. I don't use TA, I only gage the momentum and mood of the market. If people are selling / buying and the price is spiking with a certain fervor (you really have to know how much spiking to ignore as a trap) you can save yourself a lot of money by swinging with the market.

Aside from that, as long as you know if the sentiment is generally bullish or bearish you know if it's generally safer to hold or btc or usd. There's little more to than than looking at which way the market is sloping in the past 12/24 hours. If it's sideways, you can fairly safely try to trade by buying slightly lower and selling slightly higher than marker value as it spikes up and down but remains stable."	1522450622.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.208099	dwj6ak7	t1_dwj0sin	/r/Bitcoin/comments/8828f9/me_looking_at_my_what_is_left_in_my_portfolio/dwj6ak7/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

I'm not claiming I sold at 7600. I sold around 8500 the night before the slump, stayed out most afternoon, and didn't buy until it started stabilizing back from 6700 around 6900. Not only did I make almost 10%, when I choose to eventually buy back in fully (not trading today I'm out visiting family) I will buy back in at a lower price with 10% more fiat than I had before. Even if it went to 9000 before I bought back in, I'm still in a substantially better position than if I just held. 

What I was saying was, if YOU had sold late at 7600 and bought back in a day later when things stopped being a complete dumpster fire, you could have saved a lot of money rather than just convincing yourself that holding is the right tactic.

I think you telling me that traders lose 99% of the time and that it's best left to others is the excuse you use to keep yourself in the position you're in.

 Thats entirely speculative and you cant guarantee that. That type of mentality is why 90% fail. What happens if you sell at 7.6 after taking a $400 loss. You ""catch the falling knife"" buying back in a 7k, but it continues to drop and you panic sell AGAIN for another $500 loss. Thats where that mentality gets you. You cant guarantee you'll buy at the bottom or that it will ever go back up again. 

I dont wish failure on anyone and wish you the best of luck. But after day trading for the last several years i've seen bitcoin bring out the worst in people. People that have no business trading period trying to day trade. So i hold to the fact that i can not advice anyone to attempt it and holding may be the best option.

3093	Allways_Wrong	"Agreed that “investing” is probably not the correct attitude. Perhaps.  Nonetheless people can do what they want. 

I’ve exchanged my dollarydoos for bitcoin as it is simply a very utilitarian form of money, especially so for the Internet. It works better in many situations than digital fiat.

Now, fiat is also nothing more than 1s and 0s on a database somewhere, literally,  but because so many people use it it has utility as a form of money. Its strength being its enormous user base. (Backed by the government means the government is both the distributor and a major user). 

But on a purely utilitarian valuation bitcoin is excellent. As the most simple example you can send me money, right now, if I post my address here. Just like that. Compare that to sending me digital fiat. 

That for me and many others is one of its main strengths; the transfer of value is technically super elegant. 

For me its also that it is both a currency (little ‘b’ bitcoin) *and* a platform for building an entire internet of money (big B Bitcoin). Features and apps will be built on top of it. The best analogy is probably Linux, which is now by far the world’s most popular operating system. 

The Internet came for mail, publishing, music, media, and now it comes for money. What do you think will happen?

Sounds very similar to what is happening in crypto today.  Unless you're retiring or are in dire need of money today there's probably little reason to sell.

You can calculate the value of a share by projecting all of the company’s future cash flows, calculating their present value and dividing it by the number of shares. Good luck doing that with an asset that generates no cash flows.

Imagine if you bought some lean hogs and the next day Amazon unveiled a revolutionary new way to create synthetic meat that is cheaper and better than real meat in every single way.

And yeah you can save up for stuff but you're not looking to sit on it like a nest egg, you're looking to spend it to get what you want in the end. Just stockpiling money like people are currently stockpiling bitcoins is financially harmful because it's guaranteed to go down in value no matter what you do. Which is different from Bitcoin and other investments in that they can potentially increase their value, making them desirable to stockpile until they start decreasing in value, at which point everyone wants to spend or convert them but no one wants to accept them.	1522548209.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.214601	dwl7uwn	t1_dwkze1g	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88bax3/psa_bitcoin_is_not_a_get_rich_quick_scheme_so/dwl7uwn/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

This bear trend is going to wipe out all the weak cryptos. And from the perspective of someone who runs several major ecommerce deployments of bitcoin, I can tell you that these bear markets *really* increase demand for the actually as-a-currency *primary* usecase, as people find it easier to buy products with a falling bitcoin than find actual buyers-of-bitcoin.

To those that think/feel that looking at past trends are a waste of time bc the factors are different now... then this discussion is pointless.

To those that think/feel that markets move in cycles and repeat patterns...then this discussion is priceless (pun intended!)

I happen to believe in patterns repeating itself...but knowing that these are not going to be exact replicas of previous cycles bc of different times and circumstances.

I do think that the emotional/thinking patterns of humans making and losing money is always the same...for better and for worse. It’s why there are billion dollar casinos in Vegas and why the emotional sentiment from Reddit threads from previous bearish cycles look the same...

Remember, the disciplined investor does buy in the red and sell in the green.

3168	chabes	"A block is mined about every 10 min (on average), and the reward is currently 12.5 btc per mined block (plus transaction fees). When the reward is cut in half, the rate of mining blocks should remain around a 10 min average, but the payout for miners will only be 6.25 btc (plus transaction fees). This is an intentional limit on the creation of new bitcoin.

So, bitcoin won’t be mined faster. Less bitcoin will be mined with each 10 min block, so the rate itself (of newly mined bitcoin) actually gets cut in half.

Like /u/Cthulhooo said, 1800btc/day becomes 900btc/day

Edit - from Mastring Bitcoin, by Andreas Antonopoulos:

&gt; Mining creates new bitcoin in each block, almost like a central bank printing new money. The amount of bitcoin created per block is limited and diminishes with time, following a fixed issuance schedule.

And..

&gt; The process is called mining because the reward (new coin generation) is designed to simulate diminishing returns, just like mining for precious metals. Bitcoin’s money supply is created through mining, similar to how a central bank issues new money by printing bank notes. The maximum amount of newly created bitcoin a miner can add to a block decreases approximately every four years (or precisely every 210,000 blocks). It started at 50 bitcoin per block in January of 2009 and halved to 25 bitcoin per block in November of 2012. It halved again to 12.5 bitcoin in July 2016. Based on this formula, bitcoin mining rewards decrease exponentially until approximately the year 2140, when all bitcoin (20.99999998 million) will have been issued. After 2140, no new bitcoin will be issued."	1522456590.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.221599	dwjcjev	t1_dwij1g2	/r/Bitcoin/comments/883m2x/history_repeats_itself/dwjcjev/	2	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	2

In 2020 this number will be halved to 900 bitcoins per day. This means fresh 650k bitcoins produced every year for another 2 years and 330k for another 4 years.

As you may imagine this is quite a substantial amount of bitcoins introduced to the system that miners must sell in order to cover their energy and maintenance costs and turn profit. Considering a significant chunk of bitcoins is lost or never moved from their addresses for whatever reason this inflation is a bit bigger than it would ordinarily appear when compared to the total number of bitcoins."	1522431175.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.221599	dwitu3a	t1_dwij1g2	/r/Bitcoin/comments/883m2x/history_repeats_itself/dwitu3a/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

Houses and stocks lost a ton in 2008, it's looking like there could be a repeat to some effect soon enough. Every investment has risk and only hindsight ever guarantees making the right choices. I spend long enough enough tracking Bitcoin and crypto (for fun/enjoyment), its my 'extra' investment money after 401K, house payment, emergency savings, etc. If I spent any longer studying regular stocks or assets in addition to tracking crypto to know when it's a good time to enter/exit, well then I'd need more time in the day and I would be a fucking genius who beat both markets consistently. Most people don't beat markets, and they aren't geniuses in one thing let alone two.

Nobody can predict when the price will climb again.  Markets are emotional and irrational on the short term. 
 The best we can do is put a value on the system, invest accordingly, then wait.  This is the real power of the hodl strategy.  Long term, markets behave much more rationally.

Until recently, the only two viable options for currency were fiat and precious metals.  Crypto is a new and powerful player in the space.  With M2 fiat value near 21T and gold near 9T, plus the fact that USD is printed at a rate of 210B a year whereas gold is mined at a rate of 190B a year, it seems like a no brainer that crypto as a whole will eventually be valued in the trillions.

3307	localcoinatm	Anonymity is definitely the biggest factor but also because some users prefer the convenience of just doing something they're familiar with like going to an ATM, rather than learning how to purchase through online venues. Another reason is that a lot of exchanges have long verification times/cap users from purchasing large sums at once. We provide users with an alternative that is simple, safe and familiar.

And yes your rates sound nice now but what about when the price is going up or down, do you change it? How will ppl know you've changed it? They don't know, they just see BTC prices for what you say it's worth (so markups included). Correct me if I'm wrong plz.

Edit: just watched your video, ya don't say it's becoming hard to get involved. It's easy with LBC. If you don't spread misinformation ppl will spread the word about your service but if you're not 100% truthful some ppl won't spread the word. You make it seem like the network has more problems then it really has. No need to do that just for your business. Not good long term.

Some people are using bitcoin for remittances, and some are using it to escape capital controls

I would guess that most people are using it as one of the few credible hedges against the banking system collapsing.

While bitcoin tokens can be used as a currency, that particular use case is simply overshadowed by their use as a hedge.

As long as the banking and perpetual debt government budgetary mechanisms remain functional and obviously unstable, the hedge use case will loom large.

If the banking system collapses, the currency use suddenly becomes much more important.

Another scenario is that the banking system stabilizes by abandoning the manipulation of interest rates.  Basically, QE stops, and interest rates once again signal business plan risk.

At that point, the price of bitcoin stabilizes and the currency use becomes much more important.

We will know which of these scenarios wins soon enough.  I would be surprised if we don't find out within the next 2 years.

That's not what's happening.

Currencies are markers for real things: goods and services. Currencies need to be stable in the short-run to enable the transfer of those goods and services.

Economies grow. The amount of goods and services is larger over time.

Therefore the amount of currency needs to grow if there is to be any stability. 

Economies also shrink. Therefore the amount of currency needs to shrink to maintain stability.

The **edit: supply** of a currency in circulation should be matched to demand to ensure price stability.

What should the target be? Given that when the fed changes the overnight lending rate, the changes in currency supply are not 100% predictable (since supply and demand are not known instantaneously, but we usually know on which side we are erring).

The fed needs to choose a target for managing the money supply against a growing or shrinking economy. Any amount of deflation leads to more deflation, it's a negative feedback: the economy shrinks as people ""save"" more money, then prices fall further =&gt; more saving, etc. Inflation tends to be a bit more self-limiting.

So the feds choose a target money supply that is slightly inflationary."	1522384606.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.321098	dwhttbz	t1_dwhi6zq	/r/Bitcoin/comments/881xen/the_federal_reserve_silently_robbing_you_of_your/dwhttbz/	5	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	5

3374	QuantomBit	Propaganda alert. Inflation means lower interest rates and therefor less incentive to save money(hoarding in your language). If that savings is in a bank, the banks invest it in businesses  so they can acquire the working capital to produce more goods and services or enhance(innovate) upon existing production. That's why having a deflationary money supply is good. It wrings out malinvestment in the economy and allocates money where it's needed the most.	1522383227.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.321599	dwhs8z6	t1_dwhbsjc	/r/Bitcoin/comments/881xen/the_federal_reserve_silently_robbing_you_of_your/dwhs8z6/	6	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	6

3382	czarnick123	"Inflation affects economies in various positive and negative ways. The negative effects of inflation include an increase in the opportunity cost of holding money, uncertainty over future inflation which may discourage investment and savings, and if inflation were rapid enough, shortages of goods as consumers begin hoarding out of concern that prices will increase in the future. Positive effects include reducing the real burden of public and private debt, keeping nominal interest rates above zero so that central banks can adjust interest rates to stabilize the economy, and reducing unemployment due to nominal wage rigidity.[5]

They don't get to loan out 10x your deposit, they get to loan out .9X. 	1522371884.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.322099	dwhfa37	t1_dwhe7du	/r/Bitcoin/comments/881xen/the_federal_reserve_silently_robbing_you_of_your/dwhfa37/	14	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	14
3387	impulse-9	"Banks can loan out many multiples of what is deposited through a process called ""fractional reserve lending"". Essentially, the bank's reserve only has to be a fraction of what it 'can' lend to others - a bank could choose to lend conservatively (substantially less than 10x of deposits) and be well within it's reserve requirements.

Now, a system which you describe above would be much safer, although extremely conservative because it would reduce the money supply, but you're not describing what bank are allowed to do.

Basically, if you deposit $10,000 to a bank, they could lend out $100,000 and collect interest on this money created out of thin air. The system works out well as long as debts are paid, but when there are too many defaults on debt, (as well as derivative financial products built on top of these debts that are many multiples of the original debt), you end up collapsing the system like what happened a whole 10 years ago.

So then the banks created quantitative easing which was basically a tool to create trillions of made up currency that went into bank reserves, so the reserve numbers you've quoted are essentially bogus and taxpayers are on the hook to pay for it.

3388	jonknee	"I know exactly how fractional reserve lending works and it is indeed how I described. If you deposit $10,000 the bank can only lend out $9,000. 

Where you're confused is that people get loans to buy stuff and people who sell stuff often deposit that money into a bank which can then again be loaned out (less a reserve). The money supply expands, but a liability is created that balances it out. Nothing is created out of thin air. The same process works in reverse whenever you pay against a loan.

Put another way, if you loaned me 10 jackets and I in turn loaned 9 of those jackets to someone else, would you say there are any more jackets in existence? You would still say you have 10 jackets and someone else says they have 9 jackets and the bank has 1 jacket, but there really are only 10 jackets."	1522392389.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.322099	dwi1xv2	t1_dwhpmwf	/r/Bitcoin/comments/881xen/the_federal_reserve_silently_robbing_you_of_your/dwi1xv2/	6	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	6

3417	sweetsmellingrosie	I'll do you favor and explain it to you. From an accounting perspective when a dollar is spent into existence by a government it is an asset in the private sector and a liability on the public sector's books. A note exists as the physical counterpart to currency that has attached to it an obligation of return for that new money to cancel it out.  Central banks manage money/obligations for government. They will use the liabilities as financial tools to create capital flow in the global economy by selling debt obligations at low yield. To be able to do this is measure of a society's affluence. If we have a trillion dollars in debt there's that much private sector wealth. If you feel left out it is because private sector is made up of a business sector and households. You are getting shafted my friend, but it is not by central bankers. It's by capitalists who control the mode of production. The central banker cannot make anyone employ another, and for that you suffer a very personal form of pain. Central bankers have managed to make a world where you could borrow cheaply from your future low wage earnings to help you out.

No one does this because they only have shitty currencies that lose value.  Now people have a new option that does allow them to hoard currency as is the purpose and function of currency.  Money does not need to ""flow"" from person to person to create value for the individual or the economy as a whole.  It is good for individuals to hold currencies (provided they cannot be devalued via inflation) and good for the economy as well.


&gt; One dollar still meets one dollar of government obligation. What the graph doesn't show is how much you get for your dollar from your government that can float huge money supply for the private sector today with sales of debt instruments at insanely low yield. That one dollar of obligation you pay today still covers everything people had in 1913, and so much more. We are insanely more affluent because of central banks, and we are allowed easy access to our future salaries with cheap credit.

Certainly some people are insanely more affluent because of central banks but not most of us.  The affluence many of us have is a result of productivity and technological improvements that come from a market economy despite much of this being siphoned away via inflation.  We now have a new currency that allows us to avoid this shitty monetary devaluation and poor credit/lending decisions made by others who can shift the risk to others with political power.

You' re obsessed about what you can buy in secondary exchanges, and that has always changed. A car back then was not affordable. A radio in 1925 would have set you back many months worth of labor. What are we talking about when we say a dollar doesn't buy us anything any more? I was able to buy my first house with a lawn mowing summer job which landed me $6000. That's insane cheap to get into an asset class that appreciates as fast as it did. The end return for that one summer's low wage work cutting lawn (that I greatly begrudged everyone then) ended up being over 100K. Are you telling me that the central bank has not put in place a system where I could get ahead and have tremendous affluence? The possibilities today are mind blowing. Mind you, those who will borrow to bankroll a consumer lifestyle full of assets that go down in value will suffer greatly. The downside is that you are punished unfairly for your ignorance.

3420	ztsmart	"&gt; The money has not lost value. One dollar of obligation today gives you many times more than it did in 1913. 

What does this mean?  Of course one dollar scales with debt obligation denominated in dollars.  It doesn't scale with everything else from gold to labor, etc.  This is a meaningless statement like ""1 doge = 1 doge"".  The problems, and there are many, is that the amount of your government obligation/extortion has spiraled out of control. Government consumes more and more resources and part of the cost is covered by the creation of new currency that is added to the money supply--e..g when a new dollar is created someone benefits, specifically the entities that are closest to the money creation.

There are two sides to prices, the money side and the product side.  On the money side, the supply of dollars has grown greatly and this causes prices to rise--as they are more dollars.  On the product side, people have become much more efficient and productive and cost have declined as a result.  The NET some of these two factors is what many people call ""price inflation"".  On one hand you have market forces working to deliver cheaper and better goods &amp; services to everyone and on the other hand you have government exploiting their control over the currency via seigniorage.


&gt;Are you telling me that the central bank has not put in place a system where I could get ahead and have tremendous affluence? 

The current system certainly does provide an incentive to lend beyond what there would normally be in the market.  Is this a good thing?  Even if you think it is (it isn't), it provides an unfair advantage to banks that are able to profit from the creation and subsequent lending of these new dollars.  You and I are not allowed to do this, but they are--that's wrong.  People still bought houses &amp; made other investments before fractional reserve banking and they will continue to do so after Bitcoin renders FRB non-viable.

&gt;All technological advances work to free us of a labor component that was a valuable relationship in our capitalism. All the tech in the world will not put money in your pocket unless you are collecting dividends off of it.

Then you should position yourself to collect the dividends!  It will also drive the COST of goods and services down in such a way that a fixed amount of human effort and labor is able to allow for (or afford) more and more resource consumption "	1522376575.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.323100	dwhkq6c	t1_dwhiosm	/r/Bitcoin/comments/881xen/the_federal_reserve_silently_robbing_you_of_your/dwhkq6c/	6	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	6

You can't wish away inflation by imagining the money is always flowing. This just turns each dollar into a hot potato no one wants to keep. This is a very bad thing because it distorts market forces and makes it harder to save for your future. Someone is always holding the ball and experiencing that inflation.

This is wrong. Money originated as commodity-money. Without government issuance.

Fiat currencies come and go by the century, but commodity-money has existed for thousands of years, government or not.

&gt;You're probably of the opinion it has value just because we accept it.

That's literally how ALL value works. It, literally, doesn't work any other way. Things only have value to the extent that other humans accept them. Case and point, does the Bolivar have value because the Venezuelan government says so or because people accept it? (hint: citizens don't want to accept it any more)

That's like saying there's an infinite supply of gold because you can switch to dollars..."	1522381352.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.326598	dwhq4wb	t1_dwhh8at	/r/Bitcoin/comments/881xen/the_federal_reserve_silently_robbing_you_of_your/dwhq4wb/	2	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	2

3536	thieflar	"For those who aren't already aware: Roger Ver is a serial liar. A while ago I compiled together a [non-comprehensive list of examples of his lies](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6xpu8j/roger_ver_lies/dmhsmc3/), which included things like claiming to be banned from a subreddit he wasn't actually banned in (and then accidentally posting in it), egregiously misrepresenting his trial (which has a public court transcript available to contrast against), the infamous case where he vouched for Mt.Gox shortly before it imploded, and actions/policies he has taken with regards to the website(s) he controls.


In a classic case of psychological projection, Roger Ver told [a string of lies](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/61r678/rogers_latest_lie_is_out_on_twitter_acuses_aaron/dfhe7r3/) while accusing Aaron van Wirdum of being a liar.


As you can see from the thread above, Roger is often presented information which he deliberately chooses to ignore or suppress. Another excellent example of this is the case where [a single user went out of their way to vandalize a subreddit](https://twitter.com/StopAndDecrypt/status/933174301045469184) (which was repeatedly explained to Roger), and then Roger tried to [misrepresent the episode anyway](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7jax1o/i_roger_ver_will_be_doing_an_ama_on_monday_dec/). Yet another example of this is when Roger [flagrantly misrepresented history](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/825icd/in_2013_everyone_knew_that_bitcoin_could_scale_to/dv96bxf/) and was promptly made aware of how disingenous his depiction was, only to record [a video two days later which repeated (and doubled down on) the very same lie](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/82xdjm/censored_see_the_video_that_core_supporters_had/dvdsjrh/) (as well as making more untruthful statements). Note that Roger conspicuously refuses to respond to or acknowledge the facts of the matter when they are brought to his attention; [here's another example of him doing the same thing after making an unsubstantiated claim](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7zpzh7/what_i_roger_ver_think_about_op_group/duqw6q5/?context=3) (on a related note, if you were wondering what I was referring to in the first paragraph of the previous link, see [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7dlyk4/censorship/duaqgxb/); this well-documented political overmoderation/censorship of rbtc is another subject I've been trying to ask Roger about and only ever get crickets in response).


On a more ""silly"" and ""minor"" note, he likes to make misleading post titles like ""[What I (Roger Ver) think about OP_GROUP](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7zpzh7/what_i_roger_ver_think_about_op_group/)"" without actually saying what he thinks about the proposal (instead engaging in a blatant bait-and-switch where he goes on to make more lies about how their community has ""free and open discussion"" despite the fact that this is false; see the preceding paragraph to get a fuller picture and appreciation of this). On an unrelated-to-crypto note, he has gone out of his way to [defend dogfighting](https://np.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/85ifdc/convicted_dog_fighter_on_f2w/dvyc5sr/), which isn't ""dishonest"" per se, but is reprehensible in another way.


He frequently makes directly-contradictory statements, like when he said [""I've dumped a few hundred BTC for BCC"" and then two weeks later said ""I haven't cashed a single Bitcoin, or altcoin, or cash, or anything for Bitcoin Cash up until yesterday, and I sold like about a dozen Bitcoins for Bitcoin Cash.""](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7fmvix/when_you_invite_someone_to_do_a_video_interview/dqdc44h/) Note that even when he makes statements like this (which *cannot* both be true) he will sometimes try to retroactively qualify one or the other in an attempt at further deception; this represents [more lying](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7fmvix/when_you_invite_someone_to_do_a_video_interview/dqdh3ff/). In the same vein, his mining pool [signals support for BIPs that it doesn't enforce](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4zqd7g/roger_ver_does_your_bitcoin_classic_pool_on/).


He repeatedly pushes the false (and destructively misleading) propaganda that ""Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin"" and ""Bitcoin is Bitcoin Cash""; not only will he resort to [extremely childish images](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7jatfn/conclusion_bitcoin_cash_is_bitcoin/) in the name of this cause (and [repeat the tactic like a broken record](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7w6rnp/reminder_bitcoin_cash_is_effectively_bitcoin/)), but [effectively sponsors it on the bitcoin(dot)com website and the rbtc subreddit (both of which he controls)](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7vw43m/bch_is_apparently_a_scam_according_to_rbitcoin/dtwxbe7/)... to put the icing on the cake, the website was involved in [a ""bitter dispute"" between Ver and OKCoin which resulted from Ver's ""suspicious activity""](https://bravenewcoin.com/news/roger-ver-revealed-as-bitcoin-com-owner-in-bitter-dispute-with-okcoin/) and [he most likely bought the subreddit in an under-the-table deal in direct violation of reddit's Terms-of-Service](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/84djb8/did_theymos_purchase_rbitcoin_in_2011/dvp8nmi/).


There are other times where his lies and misrepresentations are more subtle. [Take this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8385wt/blockstreams_former_cto_on_bitcoin_cash/), for instance; not only is he purposefully misconstruing a quote (which he apparently doesn't even understand the underlying logic of) and pretending that it is referencing an asset *which didn't even exist at the time*, but in the image/slide Roger created, he includes a screenshot of a **BitPay service fee** as if it is a **Bitcoin network fee** during a time period in which Bitcoin transactions using *1 cent fees* were being processed. It's almost impressive *how much* duplicity Roger was able to cram into a single slide.


Another ridiculous misrepresentation he tried to get away with was the time where he mocked Andreas Antonopoulos on Twitter, and then had the gall to [later claim he ""made Andreas a millionaire""](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7kf43b/bitcoincom_wallet_2_out_of_5_stars_531_ratings_we/drei7jx/), essentially trying to take personal credit for the donations that the community (and especially @Tether_is_Fiat) provided.


He will [relentlessly promote the known scammer Craig Wright](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7r9ex7/craig_wright_dishes_out_the_truth_on_the_crypto/), promoting links like [this one](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/82axqt/craig_having_shown_me_privately_and_two_of_the/) (where it is claimed that Craig Wright is Satoshi and has possession of Satoshi's private keys) while saying things like [""In regards to me saying that Craig Wright is Satoshi, uh, **I have never said that publicly**""](https://youtu.be/E97g-zbR0aU?t=1113). 


As part of his propaganda campaign, he'll shamelessly repeat untrue headlines like [""Bitcoin cash is surging as other cryptocurrencies fall""](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7y7fgj/bitcoin_cash_is_surging_as_other_cryptocurrencies/) when the reality of the situation is that [most of the time, exchanging your BCH for BTC would have been far more profitable than not doing so](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/823zvv/the_funniest_thing_about_core_trolls_that_i_dont/dv93x53/), and this has proven more and more true as time has gone on (another fact Roger refuses to ever concede).


He will [reference fake projects](https://youtu.be/E97g-zbR0aU?t=831) (which [do not exist, and represent nothing more than misinformation for trolls to parrot](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/848gbk/rbitcoin_on_boycotts/dvohhq3/)) and gets [*extremely* emotional and irrationally upset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCOjCEth6xI) when people use the phrase ""bcash"" to refer to BCH (despite being willing to repeatedly and aggressively misrepresent ""Bitcoin"" as ""Bitcoin Core"", even though the former is a network and asset and the latter is a software client and node implementation). Note that the video link just provided includes Roger Ver ""rage quitting"" from the interview with the quote: ""I've never hired a single sockpuppet"" which [has now been proven to be *another* false statement](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/87t3ot/delicious_proof_that_roger_employs_sockpuppets/).


A long time ago, he also [abused his admin rights on blockchain(dot)info to dox (and fully publish) a user's information](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/76u1ft/that_one_time_roger_ver_abused_his_administrator/) over a *$50 dispute* which was the result of *Roger accidentally sending the user BTC* and which had *nothing to do with blockchain(dot)info in the first place*. When the community lambasted him for this (obviously unethical) behavior, he locked and edited the thread to try to cover it up and sweep it under the rug. Fortunately for us (and unfortunately for Roger's reputation), the incident is archived.


This isn't a comprehensive breakdown, either. [Others have compiled](https://decentralize.today/roger-ver-lies-f5333e152858) similar [histories](https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@gank/the-truth-about-roger-ver-and-bch-and-why-you-and-your-usd-should-stay-away) of [Roger Ver lying](https://medium.com/@WhalePanda/roger-ver-from-bitcoin-jesus-to-bitcoin-antichrist-69fc7a17c622), and even *those* don't cover everything. There are tons of other examples where Roger Ver showed the world his true colors, and **they are ugly**."	1522366217.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.335614	dwh8np0	t3_880ze8	/r/Bitcoin/comments/880ze8/this_sockpuppet_account_is_run_by_bitcoincom/dwh8np0/	137	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	137

That way anyone can link to it to show others who Roger Ver really is in an easy to read and digest format. We could also keep it updated with all his new lies which you know are coming. You could also ad to this that Roger Ver thinks that insider trading is totally OK and should be legal and the fact that he keeps co-opting the #metoo hashtag meant for survivors of sexual assault to push his bcash scam. Even when he was pressed on this he admitted that he did it because it would get more views which totally makes it OK.	1522379046.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.335614	dwhnjwm	t1_dwh8np0	/r/Bitcoin/comments/880ze8/this_sockpuppet_account_is_run_by_bitcoincom/dwhnjwm/	5	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	5

3584	NigelClutterbuck	"BCash keeps talking about the original intention of Satoshi and how that is supposed to be ""quality"".

Guess what, the white paper as well as the original version of bitcoin didn't differentiate between miners and users, _and_ the client software had a built in miner so that anyone who wants can join the mining effort. Satoshi changed hes mind along the way, just as he did about implementing a market right into the client itself.

Determining quality based on how old something is doesn't hold water. There is no reason to believe Satoshi would disagree with the latest improvements.

It's time to call the real reason why the miners created a fork of the protocol, they are worried about not being in control of the hashing algorithm.

He dedicates his (considerable) assets towards hurting Bitcoin on a daily basis, and the propaganda which he relentlessly pushes and finances is having a definite (and definitely *negative*) effect on the perception of Bitcoin.

If we are able to counter Ver's efforts with truth, rationality, and *correct* information (to combat the disinformation he puts out) we can hopefully hasten the fade-into-relative-obscurity that the man and his preferred altcoin(s) are destined for.

This subreddit is *not* about Roger Ver, and we work hard to make sure it's not regularly flooded with Ver-related content, but as he is an influential figure in the cryptocurrency (and Bitcoin-related) ecosystem and noosphere, exceptions in some cases make sense.

If you don't like the Ver-centric threads (and I completely empathize with you most of the time on this), report them to the mods and/or downvote them, and then move on."	1522368376.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.338600	dwhb666	t1_dwh9n35	/r/Bitcoin/comments/880ze8/this_sockpuppet_account_is_run_by_bitcoincom/dwhb666/	10	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	10

If people think Ver had anything to do with this massive drop, Bitcoin and all of Crypto is in big trouble. I am in no way defending Ver, but my point is he doesn't matter. the illusion is tricking people that he does to take the spot light away from what ever took BTC from $20k to $7. 

Anyone else wonder why crypto Debit/Credit were cut off @ the peak and all of a sudden brought back now that we've hit new lows? if i was going to pump/dump all of crypto, id make sure its hard for people to exit, while i pump.

I promise you, Ver, Andreas... have almost nothing to do with where the price was, and where it is now. 

Pay attention to the fundamentals, understand when manipulation is occurring &amp; and dont let crap like this distract you.

3702	s0cket	This opinion is just as meaningless as those who think Bitcoin will be the dominant world currency in 20 years (or ever). Bitcoin is useful and interesting. It’s going to grow exponentially in adoption over time. You sound salty to be honest.... Bitcoin is literally changing how people view money all around the world. It’s likely one of the most amazing software creations of the last 20-30 years. What makes you think technology doesn’t filter down to the masses? We’re early adopters in a technology that’s literally in its infancy. Feel free to write it off as a fad that’ll just eventually go away.

What makes a blockchain special is the amount of trust it's users have in it and it's level of security (hash rate). Anyone can start a new blockchain and call it whatever they want. But, it's totally meaningless and has basically no application outside of a very limited scope. What makes Bitcoin **the** de facto blockchain implementation is the security of the network and it's user base. I'll say it one more time. **You can't not separate Bitcoin and blockchain technology** as they are one and the same. You're simply implying that someone can make an altcoin... yes, we know that. Look how well that's working out for those who are trying.

3742	affirmed_78	Agreed, I'm waiting for bitcoin to actually go up while alts flatline or go down before getting optimistic.  It's possible we could spend a year or so in purgatory down about 80% from the top before regaining traction, like 2013-2015.

I think there is quite some potential to improve the handling of funds to make it even easier and convenient for more people to keep their funds safe. Sure some people have probably tried to profit big time with the latest spike, but hopefully at least that brings more interest to crypto. Remember that a spike also happened 2 years ago.

Cryto currency still makes it much easier and cheaper to transfer funds to others. The only thing to worry about is volatility, which happens when there are relatively not many people using it and some big players come in at the right time."	1522362234.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.351098	dwh4a3r	t1_dwgvse9	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87zrkv/forbes_looking_ahead_to_20000_bitcoin/dwh4a3r/	8	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	8

""And I sincerely believe with you, that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies; and that the principle of spending money to be paid by posterity, under the name of funding, is but swindling futurity on a large scale"" -- Jefferson to Taylor, May 28, 1816

While the other two sound more like something from early Monroe or an early James Madison (before he went on to form the second national bank), all three of such individuals certainly did have their issues with national banks being anti-federalists.

In fact, if you don't believe it, look at this prescient quote from Madison:
""If Congress can apply money indefinitely to the general welfare, and are the sole and supreme judges of the general welfare, they may take the care of religion into their own hands; they may establish teachers in every State, county, and parish, and pay them out of the public Treasury; they may take into their own hands the education of children, establishing in like manner schools throughout the Union; they may undertake the regulation of all roads other than post roads. In short, every thing, from the highest object of State legislation, down to the most minute object of police, would be thrown under the power of Congress; for every object I have mentioned would admit the application of money, and might be called, if Congress pleased, provisions for the general welfare."" -- James Madison, remarks on the House Floor, debates on Cod Fishery bill (February 1792).

I suspect that in their later lives others outside of Madison and Monroe dulled on the idea of national banks, but most of the founding fathers had a very healthy bit of of skepticism of them early on."	1522390893.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.358099	dwi0fs9	t1_dwhy1xy	/r/Bitcoin/comments/883zea/interesting_quote_by_thomas_jefferson/dwi0fs9/	7	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	7

3831	Hizonner	"An 18th century writer would be more likely to have begun a hypothetical with ""should"" than with ""if"". The most likely form would have probably been along the lines of ""Should the people of the United States come to allow..."". I could be wrong, though; I'm not an expert.

An 18th century writer would normally have said ""the people of the United States"", not ""the American people"". I'm not even sure ""American"" was used in that sense at all.

The word ""inflation"" was not used with respect to currency until the late 19th century. ""Deflation"" is later

 And an 18th century writer would probably have been writing from the viewpoint that the primary currency was coin, not notes, let alone fiat. Fractional reserve wasn't much of a thing, either. Therefore there'd be no assumption that the audience would have a clue what an ""issuing power"" would be, or that the audience would expect a bank to have any power to inflate the currency, whatever you called inflating the currency.

And, by the way, they would have said something like ""power of issue"" or ""power of issuance"" or something, because ""issuing power"" would have meant a power that was coming out of something, not a power to create something. I suspect that ""power"" would not even have been the basic word they'd have chosen, but I could be wrong about that.

The word ""corporation"" was not used in that way in the 18th century.

""Awaken"" would have been used instead of ""wake up"", except that the whole concept of waking probably wouldn't have been used to begin with.

""Homeless"" was not commonly used to allude to poverty in general until the 20th century.

Etc, etc, etc.

If by ""the capitalism that ensued"" you mean the effects of the Fed's policies, then I agree. But this is exactly why the Fed wasn't ""for the social good"" - its exactly the power to print money indiscriminately and without regulation or audit that makes it so terrible. If we legislated the Fed's policies, it would be much less terrible - tho the incentives for abuse would still be there.

Let’s use a hypothetical situation. Everyone says it won’t work but it does and will. 

Let’s say there are levels of people selling and each level has tens of thousands of bitcoin owners. All each person has to do is name his price and the order book fills up and reverses the trend. 

So you will have a wave of various people selling above what the current market was and all the sharks who are dumping waiting to buy back in will get fucked hard.

Start with a just a little bit for the first buy and see what happens and wait a few days to a week before buying significantly more bitcoin. Watch the charts and how your investment does. Even if you've traded stocks or fx before, you won't really be able to understand how this market moves until you're in the game. Don't go throwing 1 lakh in as soon as your first purchase yields 10%.

I think more importantly though, **learn about the technology** behind bitcoin and understand why and how it is attracting buyers.

The way that MW works is fairly different than the way btc works, so deploying it on the btc network would require large changes to the btc code. So MW will first prove it’s legitimacy as its own network, or perhaps as a sodechain.

I have money in Crypto as well, but it's not borrowed and it's not from my savings.

I was in Northern Zambia last year, astonishing 4G network thanks to Chinese infrastructure investment, but most people are walking and cycling for up to eight hours to buy food from the markets and don't have running water or electricity at home. Men work one to four days travel away from the subsistence farms their wives run to feed the children, motorised transport is extremely rare for the majority of people not from a tribal elite background.

Phones are restricted to the few with good jobs (&lt;$100 USD per month), and even then you're talking about iPhone 3G era handsets or cheap 3G feature phones (cheap meaning a months wages).

Hmm I have been trying to implement a platform to do exactly this since last year. Although the major hurdle is how would you make sure the investor gets the returns? How would you go about the legal process to grant this African guy his equity? How can he ask for the dividends if you start screwing him up from US (in this hypothetical case)? If it's loaned, how can he collect interests?

It's not easy at it sounds. If you have a solution on these problems, hit me up. Because people are trying from allover the world to make sustainable equity crowdfunding platforms but the industry is still not booming as much in third world. What you said works best only in UK &amp; EU. It's still nascent in US &amp; seen as too risky in other parts of the world."	1522329149.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.492100	dwgkx04	t1_dwg03qt	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87v6wp/bitcoins_popularity_in_africa_continues_to_soar/dwgkx04/	2	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	2

Currencies work best when that purchasing power is stable.  So if you are excited about bitcoin as a currency then that is largely incomparable with expecting the price to rise considerably.  

As I said, if you got paid in USD and one day you could buy a loaf of bread for $1, but in two weeks you could buy 4 loaves of bread with $1, and in a month a loaf of bread cost $5.

Amazing art projects like the [bitcoin roundabout](https://amp.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/83vfw1/this_roundabout_was_just_unveiled_in_kranj/) in Slovenia requires cycling BTC back into fiat in order to pay the contractors, architects, builders, artists...  This is what we have to do to get things done in this imperfect world.  

Not to mention all the programmers, designers and engineers behind all this that still need to eat ramen :p

At the end of the day, it doesn't matter at this juncture whether we're using bitcoin, euros, tally sticks or sea shells to breathe oxygen into all these endeavours, as long as we're doing a better job funding the right people for the right reasons than an old world that's struggling to breathe due to a whole bunch of red tape stymying progress...

I know [we're all eager to see that more perfect world](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/gE8hDnY) right this instant... and there *will* come a time when mass adoption leads to there being no need for fiat on/off ramps (and when that happens BTC will stabilise) but that requires **scale** which will come from lightning and sidechains.  And, like all grand human engineering endeavours that changed the planet before... It also takes time and patience to build that new world.

If you got in on the get rich quick bandwagon, zoom out and relax.  You're very lucky to have gotten in so soon... So well done on getting such a great window seat in the lunar shuttle :)

Similarly if you go into a casino and sit down at the blackjack table and lose a bunch of hands you don't get to claim ""I haven't lost until I cash out!""

Anyways, at $17,460 I wasn't trying to ride the bitcoin wave, but was hoping and expecting other coins to pop. I was interested in IOTA as I liked their concept (Tangle/DAG) and future possible uses. I still do... I was supposed to transfer the bitcoin to binance (i made an account) and purchase IOTA. During my waiting period, Bitcoin's value fell and I was not able to purchase as much IOTA as I wanted. I held hoping it would climb back up to initiate the transfer. In the meantime, I read more about IOTA and the issues or risks associated with their wallets. Add on Binance being a Chinese exchange and I somewhat soured on that idea. 

Basically, I became stuck with bitcoin and holding was nothing more than a manifestation of pride/ego. I became obsessed with price checking and reading reddit posts. Eventually, I went to Poloniex and started lending BTC. Started to do a bit more research and found two coins I enjoy and feel they'll be here for the next pop. Currently, I'm ""all-in"" with LTC and BURST but I tend to keep up with BTC as it's the gauge for the health of the market.

Hadn't visited r/Bitcoin in a bit (pun intended), somewhat saddening that the excitement has completely subsided. That's the reason I decided to post.. to some, 1k @ 19k is a lot. To me, 5k @ $17.5k is a lot, while others may think it is just 1 paycheck. In the end, it is subjective and there are others out there (loans, mortgage, withdrew their 401k).

I would really like direct currency trades without having to use btc... however, that would have negative effects on btc. 
I don't see btc as functional currency, but rather digital gold (i know many hate this). This would cement its place in the market. Everything would be backed by bitcoin. The monetary value of bitcoin would remain high. In my eyes, it is a trailblazer that will continue to be the backbone of crypto. As bitcoin goes, crypto goes (like our current state).

Because of that ^ reasoning. I went all in on 2 coins that I believe in and allow me to breathe easily. I noticed that staring at declining values gives a completely different feeling if the amount is not $x,xxx. I have a similar feeling when trading options on stocks. So I need to stick with what I'm comfortable. One gives me the feeling that I can't afford to lose this while the other allows me to think long term.

4474	NotSoAnonymous44	"FOMO. I remember seeing it at $400-$1000 and not pulling the trigger. Then I saw the articles of the price increasing from 6k to 14k within a short period. 

I didn't want to invest in bitcoin (as you said, it went parabolic)... looked for projects I liked with potential. Found IOTA. Not only did I need bitcoin to get IOTA but I needed a binance account. 

Once the binance account was made, not only did the bitcoin price fall (due to a major management error by coinbase), but I had soured on IOTA. Their wallet and the risks that came with it was too much. 

So I became stuck with btc as it declined and other alts boomed. 

Now I hold 2 coins. Doesn't make a huge difference as the entire market is going down, but it's an easier pill to swallow when the declining number is closer to an average tech stock price than Berkshire A. So that has helped keep me sane and forget about my gamble.

4495	Hi_Azuma	I just wanted to point out that BTC is not a ponzi scheme of virtual tokens where people got rich from the current buyers (bagholders). It has got actual use instead of just being a speculating instrument. Its actual decentralized nature gives people a chance to escape the theft of corrupt governments like Zimbabwe and Venezuela where unscrupulous printing of money dissolves the worth of their savings. And you don't need to open a bank account in a foreign country (which is extremely difficult for the majority of the population). 	1522430332.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.681603	dwiti14	t1_dwihbss	/r/Bitcoin/comments/885jn4/weekly_volume_from_localbitcoin_in_venezuela_has/dwiti14/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

A sane person would put a little in each so they have a better risk profile, but to avoid an asset class entirely out of the fear of the downturns is comically myopic."	1522484544.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.689600	dwk34zz	t1_dwj0c2b	/r/Bitcoin/comments/886l9h/i_admire_the_optimism_on_this_sub/dwk34zz/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

4537	Darkbitsky	I would assume that shorters prefer to coordinate in larger pools of shorting-traders to spread the risk and leverage better pool liquidity. If bulls are smart they will likewise coordinate in larger pools of long-traders and buyers, scooping low and selling high, with the combined pool liquidity reducing the average cost-risk factor. When both tactics disrupt each other there will be more risk for the shorters and that's when we will see a less onesided market.	1522437316.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.692103	dwiwfkh	t3_889kq0	/r/Bitcoin/comments/889kq0/shorters/dwiwfkh/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

Futures traders may be able to depress the price of bitcoin for a while, but all it takes is a bit of hype or new use case and suddenly the demand for outpaces supply and shorters get crushed.

I keep thinking we need to retest the 6k low from Feb, but looking at the old charts, BTC spins up from a crash just as quick as it falls from a bubble. We can't assume anything with it's movements. I could also draw bottom lines from July 2017 to Feb 2018 and say we oversold and should be 11-12k now...

4726	Steven81	"Why though?

Back then liquidity was shot, right now there is no systemic issues other than a correction to a parabolic curve. We are now at the levels before the last parabolic run, so unless bitcoin is indeed going down, the price must start creeping up shortly.

Keep in mind that all is happening in low volumes, so the current picture is a bit of a misdirection.

I mean most news sites are explaining this recent correction as due to ""regulatory woes"". Most bull runs happened amidst ""regulatory woes"", so it can't be it. It merely went up too fast so it had to go back down eventually for no reason other than being too early for such an increase in value."	1522386012.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.742603	dwhve87	t1_dwh4jwo	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87zaxt/after_255_straight_days_on_track_to_the_mcafee/dwhve87/	3	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	3

People I have talked to about BTC  sneeringly asked ""So did you get out before the crash lol?"" The public saw a 60% drop and assume it's dead.  Let the price linger for a couple years, then people will forget, more positive stories in the media than negative ones, and the price slowly creeps up.  As soon as it touches the previous ATH of $20k, it will shoot to $200k in an instant.  Then immediately crash back to $80k, and the cycle will continue.

4736	RelentlessFurnace	If the recent 2017/2018 bubble is the same played out as the one in 2013/14 I STILL see $500,000 by that time. Who said Bitcoin(or really anything) moves in a predictable fashion. This time around it is happening faster. If we got a 2013 repeat with more speed, then it entails we go down to $3500 for a few weeks at the bottom(maybe in the fall) and spend most of the rest of 2018 and part of 2019 between 5k and 15k. Toward the end of 2019 beginning of 2020 were at about 30-40k. and similar to 2017 there is a surge during 2020. That brings us potentially as high at $650,000. So based on that it would come down to the wire for the old man's dick.	1522348139.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.743600	dwgtvrd	t3_87zaxt	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87zaxt/after_255_straight_days_on_track_to_the_mcafee/dwgtvrd/	19	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	19

4782	Earth2Andy	"I don't disagree that dollar could end up in a state of high inflation.  But there's no way the US dollar will ever experience the type of inflation bitcoin has seen so far this year.

Your entire premise for why people will buy this much bitcoin by 2020 is built on the idea that bitcoin will have become a very stable store of value that people trust over gold and every other currency on earth.  
Given the wild swings of the last decade (and even the last month) it seems pretty unlikely in just 30 months.  Hell it seems unlikely in 30 years.

4784	Earth2Andy	"The problem with your argument is you're assuming the value of bitcoin stays static, which we all know it doesn't.


Let's pretend the dollar hyperinflation you're predicting (50%/yr?) had started Jan 1st this year.  If you took $2000 on Jan 1 put half of it in Bitcoin and half of it you left in paper dollars, the paper dollars would still be able to buy you more today than the bitcoin.  Even with the dollar losing 50%/yr of it's purchasing power, because bitcoin is falling faster.

Over the last (almost) decade bitcoin has been more volatile than every currency on earth.  More volatile than any major commodity!  Given that there's no end in sight to that volatility, there are are *literally* thousands of better places to put your money than bitcoin to protect yourself against inflation.  So why do you think bitcoin is going to be the vehicle of choice for so many people by 2020?

4785	NarfMann	"I'm assuming no such thing. The opposite, in fact. 

I'm guessing that the value of bitcoin will continue to be volitile until adoption picks up to some level that a consensus of its value can be reached.  I'm guessing that the value of bitcoin will continue its overall trajectory until that time. This means that (by my guess) the price will be several orders of magnitude higher than it is now at some point in the next couple of years. All guesses, no assumptions. 

What I'm assuming is that the value of the dollar will decrease, as evidenced by its entire history, and truly the history of all unbacked fiat currency. IF it decreases rapidly like Venezuela's currency has, then a million dollars per bitcoin is possible even IF the value were to remain static. 

Note all of the uncertain language; I'm not assuming anything that isn't unreasonable to assume. "	1522397023.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.851612	dwi6d7d	t1_dwi4y04	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87zaxt/after_255_straight_days_on_track_to_the_mcafee/dwi6d7d/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

Your prediction is it's going to go up by several orders of magnitude and become more widely adopted as a currency at the same time, until it's so widely adopted that the price stabilizes?

The problem is, those two things are mutually exclusive.  People don't spend rapidly appreciating assets unless they absolutely have to, it's the reason that deflation is so scary for a capitalist society.

4840	-Claymore-	"I think it's tin-foil-hat.

Many bitcoin fanatics have been calling for the comming of financial institutions.
What thse smucks don't realize, is that financial institutions are only interested in one thing. Profit.

So why is the price going down? Is it market manipulation? Well, unregulated markets always have manipulation.

So what is this time?

In my opinion, two things. 1) No real demand; 2) Bear market.

Why buy now when you can by later at a discount? Now, the tricky thing is, when is later the right time?

My guess is that bitcoin is largely overvaluated. We know for a fact that the price was pumped (manipulated) from 150 to 1K, so there's no reason to think there wasn't also manipulation from 1k to 20k.

So, maybe bitcoin is just correcting and this is, maybe, the result of having a market without manipulation. Maybe bitcoin value is droping becaus the real correction isn't over. Maybe the real value is bellow $100, before the real manipulation started."	1522451128.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.858100	dwj6svn	t3_88ass0	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88ass0/could_goldman_sachs_be_the_great_manipulator_to/dwj6svn/	2	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	2

The buildup to ATH in mid-December and subsequent crashes/dips/corrections can be explained from a wide variety of perspectives without the need for some perceived culprit.

I am sure there is some degree of market manipulation since cryptocurrency markets are unregulated. (That's why other markets are regulated) Combine this with bot trading, greed, fear, whale traders and possibly pools of traders working together for mutual benefit. However, this isn't equal to assigning blame to a particular entity.

4893	lilduke196	Not a bad read at all. Comparing  bitcoin to the model T I think is a great way to look at it. Bit coin is/will be the beginning of the discovery of how to '' manufacture'' using the blockchain technology. Look at how long it has taken from that point to be where we are now in car manufacturing. Altcoins have already surpressed that time span tremendously. The whole computation power thing though, honestly by the point bitcoin itself is supposed to max out I'm sure computers of now a days will be viewed the same as when a whole room was filled with components to run the simplest computation, which you hold in your hand now with over x100 the power. 	1522426612.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.870601	dwirzor	t3_888r0g	/r/Bitcoin/comments/888r0g/the_problems_with_bitcoin_and_the_future_of/dwirzor/	-1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	-1

There are basically two types of Bitcoin buyers. Those exiting the fiat system for digital scarcity and a known inflation rate and those trying to make a quick buck. Post-2013 the charge is always led by the latter, and a fraction of those stay and learn about the technology, joining the former camp during the eventual bear market.

It tells you the equivalent Bitcoin Gold address, and confirms that address has value. Claiming the Bitcoin Gold is simple. Find an exchange which changes Bitcoin Gold to Bitcoin. Install a Bitcoin Gold wallet. Import the Bitcoin key(s) into the Bitcoin Gold wallet. Send the transaction to the exchange.

With a healthy network more and more companies will accept btc payments (even if they insta sell their btc for Fiat). The thing is Bitcoin is a finite asset, so as more and more companies start using it, the more value must each Bitcoin posses in order to keep up with the amount of money being transacted, even if they depend on third party liquidity providers to handle the Bitcoin payments. This companies will still be stalled if for example, they can handle 300 million dollars a day in transactions, but the market, thanks to adoption, now requires 500 million. This inevitably makes a price increase necessary as it needs to be more attractive for Bitcoin hodlers to sell their btc in order to keep up with demand. 	1522459456.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.889600	dwjflj7	t3_889ya2	/r/Bitcoin/comments/889ya2/the_biggest_myth_about_bitcoin_you_believe_it_too/dwjflj7/	2	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	2

There are a lot of very fresh accounts that post here (and probably are responsible for upvoting each other also) - and often exclusively here - with extremely negative statements about bitcoin and its future.

The most likely scenario seems to be that it is a coordinated and deliberate attempt both to reduce confidence in bitcoin as well as increase the appearance of bitcoin users as being naiive and/or stupid (which further decreases confidence in those who are just investigating it for the first time).

Social attacks on bitcoin from those with vested interests against it (be it the traditional financial industry or alt-coins) are to be expected.  Some will likely be reasonably successful, since as social animals we easily fall prey to this kind of attack, but it's my expectation that long term, the inherent value of bitcoin (which exists whether people understand it or not) will be sufficient to overcome these kinds of attacks also."	1522432895.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.892602	dwiuisd	t3_888xaj	/r/Bitcoin/comments/888xaj/negativity_all_around_this_subreddit/dwiuisd/	4	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	4

4991	cryptomode2018	"If you are a miner and your break even basis is for example- 4k USD. 

A simple way to look at things:

Bitcoin drops to 3900
You stop selling and hold in order to not lose fiat
Every miner eventually holds to not lose fiat in that scenario as it affects them
Miners continue to mine knowing the chain of causation and every miner in that position will need to hold to prevent loss at some point
Price of BTC goes up

Other factors include: Sell off exhaustion(even whales eventually run out), world news, new tech(roadmap goals being met), influential exposure

Essentially, the risk of a 51% attack happening directly from a price drop of BTC is very low but none the less still possible. I don't know the exact drop in a two week period answer but it would be an interesting answer if someone can calculate that"	1522468744.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.897601	dwjp4kh	t3_88cui9	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88cui9/will_a_significant_price_drop_enable_a_51_attack/dwjp4kh/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1
4992	raakakakku	"You assume that a miner would continue to mine even below cost and simply hold on to the bitcoin reward. That would be irrational: once the marginal cost of mining is below the value of the reward, a miner would be better off not mining (and, like everyone else, buy bitcoin for less than the cost of mining, if they wish to speculate on an eventual price increase).

There must be bitcoin price where, without a change in difficulty, mining is unprofitable for, say, 10% of current miners, another (lower) price where it is unprofitable for 50%, and yet another (even lower) price where it is unprofitable for 99%.

At the moment, the marginal costs of individual miners are very diverse, so it's possible that even a very large price drop does not result in a 50% reduction of the hash rate. As mining becomes more concentrated, and the marginal costs even out, the hash rate should get more sensitive to price drops."	1522470927.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.897601	dwjr9ov	t1_dwjp4kh	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88cui9/will_a_significant_price_drop_enable_a_51_attack/dwjr9ov/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1
4993	cryptomode2018	I should have been a bit more specific. You are assuming that a miner is mining as it used to be back in the day. Yes it used to be like that. Not anymore though and that's why I assume the actual impact miners with large buildings dedicated to mining operating with plenty of operational solar power will always be mining since the cost would just be the equipment which for the most part would still be plenty profitable at that point. There is not just one person or entity with those kind of mining operations either. Even someone in the general public can go solar with their house and factor in mining into the equation of distribution these days as affordable as it is and with the government incentives(USA at least).	1522485123.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.897601	dwk3m2u	t1_dwjr9ov	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88cui9/will_a_significant_price_drop_enable_a_51_attack/dwk3m2u/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

In other words, if you're someone who values everything in USD, then you can indeed ""buy"" and ""sell"" euro on foreign exchange markets.  However, if you're someone who travels back and forth between the eurozone and the US, then the terms become much more ambiguous.  You're exchanging euro for dollars in one direction and dollars for euro in the other, but both of them are intended for use as currency, not as a speculative investment based on their relative exchange rates.  Both ""buy"" and ""sell"" can be used for the either of the exchange directions depending on how you view it, which makes them pretty bad/confusing terms to use.

As bitcoin is global, it has no local geographic environment.  Accordingly, the terms ""buy"" and ""sell"" reflect something closer to the speculative investment foreign currency exchange than they do the exchange for the purposes of usage of the currency."	1522440266.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.910098	dwixzai	t1_dwiwfnb	/r/Bitcoin/comments/889l3x/buy_and_sell_are_misleading_terms/dwixzai/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

5044	dalebewan	"&gt; The exchange of currencies you mention also involves a buying and selling transaction.

Yes, it does.  But in a transaction where I exchanged some of my euro for some bitcoin, it's equally as valid to say, ""I sold some euro"" as it is to say ""I bought some bitcoin"".  People almost exclusively use the latter though, which is what leads to the perception of bitcoin as something other than a true currency."	1522440607.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.910601	dwiy6fa	t1_dwixz2d	/r/Bitcoin/comments/889l3x/buy_and_sell_are_misleading_terms/dwiy6fa/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

When we say we exchanged an item for another we 'see' an exchange transaction i.e. I give you my bicycle for your skateboard, we swap items.

When we acquire something and use money to do so we buy it, we do not say we exchanged our money for something i.e. I went to the market and exchanged my money for groceries.

The ""I had to buy some dollars..."" example is closer to the point, but it ignores that that is a scenario where you have an implicit *local currency* (e.g. euro) that you're buying the US dollars with.  With bitcoin, that line gets blurred a bit since it is just as much a local currency as your fiat (by virtue of being global).

5047	RustyNomad	"&gt;I think the groceries example is fundamentally different in that ""groceries"" aren't a currency. You intend to consume them and they have no intended purpose of further trade.

Depends on your circumstances. I do buy to 'consume'. I buy plenty of bitcoin for the sole purpose of making money transfers so I buy it, transfer it and then sell it again. However, one can also say I'm exchanging and not buying.

Also, many see bitcoin as an 'asset', they buy it in the hope that it appreciates in value. So from their point of view they are not exchanging currencies but rather buying an item/asset. So I guess it depends on your point of view.

I get what you are saying but the buy/sell is so ingrained in trading that I doubt it will ever be referred to as 'exchanging'."	1522442416.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.910601	dwizc1k	t1_dwiz3xv	/r/Bitcoin/comments/889l3x/buy_and_sell_are_misleading_terms/dwizc1k/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

I absolutely agree with you there.

That's actually what I was getting at with my very first paragraph.  This post is aimed squarely at those who do *not* have that point of view.  For those who do, ""buy"" and ""sell"" are perfectly valid terms.

&gt; I get what you are saying but the buy/sell is so ingrained in trading that I doubt it will ever be referred to as 'exchanging'.

That's sort of my point though.  I find the viewpoint and behaviour of people engaged in bitcoin purely for trading to be somewhat detrimental on the whole to the ecosystem.  I can't stop them and wouldn't want to have the ability to do so (as that would imply a fundamental power that I strongly believe should not exist) so for now, it is how it is.  I can however do my best to educate people about what I see as the most interesting and valuable aspects of bitcoin, and one small part of that is the view of it as a real currency, where I see the usage of the terms ""buy"" and ""sell"" hindering this more accurate perception."	1522443269.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.910601	dwizx9l	t1_dwizc1k	/r/Bitcoin/comments/889l3x/buy_and_sell_are_misleading_terms/dwizx9l/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

The main issue is that they run a full-steam propaganda machine against Bitcoin, which is unfortunately effective, especially among users that lack all the historical perspective. 

First impression when you naively look at rbtc is that rBitcoin is censoring out all the opposing views and disallowing ""free discussion"", while they ""unmoderatedly allow it"". They will then point at some particular instances where some stupid comment by Roger was downvoted to -100.

It really takes some time looking at the sources and the arguments, engaging in discussions and their post dynamics, to realize that it is indeed rbtc who are banning and rate-limiting most of the opposing views, while only permitting a reduced subset, or that rbitcoin has a strict but clear moderation while rbtc is much more arbitrary, with policy that goes as far as banning and hiding obvious factual truths."	1522351202.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.923601	dwgvfyw	t1_dwgp7u8	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87yxhy/banned_from_rbtc_simply_for_stating_a_verifiable/dwgvfyw/	15	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	15

The reason for this ban is alleged ban evasion.

Well yea, I know that, It's called virtue signaling and It's done here too. The word Bcash is a perfect counter example. I've been mostly petrified to comment here for a few years now. The ONLY reason I ever subscribed there was because of the ALLEGED heavy handed ban hammering here. I know you all (mods on both subs) don't deserve ALL of the criticism given but it became obvious to me (because of my own research / and maybe libertarian biases) that a lot of it was. So I'm not sure if I'd be considered a ""there account"" or a ""here account"" but I ain't scared to write out my off the cuff opinions there, whereas here I usually just read and keep the hype or fud to myself.

&gt; before we finally have to permaban them.

Why? Any opinion however true it may be, if it is not fully, frequently, and fearlessly discussed will be held as a dead dogma, not a living truth. I find It's pretentious when people think they need to curate content for me. For me the deontological considerations concerning censorship and intellectual freedom take precedence over consequentialist arguments. 

It usually happens when people think their opinion on a matter is infallible. Silencing of discussion is an assumption of that infallibility. Even if the opinion some wish to censor is largely false, it may contain some portion of truth, a portion denied us if we suppress the speech which contains it. 

I'm a free-software zealot and find it ironically laughable how politicized the word fork is in crypto conversations. It's a ""four letter word"" around here. Yet in the free software world it's celebrated and enshrined.

Censorship is wrong because it makes it less likely that truth will be discovered or preserved, and it is wrong because it has destructive consequences for the intellectual character of those who live under it.

5088	throckmortonsign	"""The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.

A generation ago, multi-user time-sharing computer systems had a similar problem. Before strong encryption, users had to rely on password protection to secure their files, placing trust in the system administrator to keep their information private. Privacy could always be overridden by the admin based on his judgment call weighing the principle of privacy against other concerns, or at the behest of his superiors. Then strong encryption became available to the masses, and trust was no longer required. Data could be secured in a way that was physically impossible for others to access, no matter for what reason, no matter how good the excuse, no matter what.

It's time we had the same thing for money. With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless.""

Genesis block dude. 

You are right that Satoshi tried to avoid ideological positions when he wrote on social media but that doesn't mean that he did not hold ideological positions it just meant that he was very careful on how he communicated them.

He was highly critical towards banks in his [p2p foundation post](http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/m/discussion?id=2003008%3ATopic%3A9402) and the paper embedded into the Genesis block is quite clearly an ideological statement against banks and inflation.

What's satoshi wasn't by any statement that I've seen was a anarchist. I don't see anywhere where he has advocated about removing government. He clearly just wanted to design a better system for society ran by society that treated citizens around the world more equally. Any extrapolation beyond that is really out of satoshi's written context.

So you are partially right and mostly wrong."	1522363933.0	2018-04-01 16:33:00.925604	dwh63we	t1_dwgz80i	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87yxhy/banned_from_rbtc_simply_for_stating_a_verifiable/dwh63we/	4	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	4

You got banned for not spoofing a new IP after getting another account banned. You're a proven sock puppeteer. And you got justifiably banned for it. If it wasn't for your VPN you wouldn't be allowed to post on this site at all for breaking the rules over and over again (Reddit rules, not sub rules).

You can dislike my opinions, or link an old comment of mine where a shill was lying, I proved him wrong with sources, and then he kept lying... Kind of like you are right now (Dunno what that has to do with you breaking Reddit site rules). But you're a proven sock puppet that should be banned site wide due to using a VPN and sock puppet account to circumvent ban evasion. That's a provable fact, not an opinion. In fact, I'm reporting you to the admins right now. Hopefully you aren't spoofing a Mac address and will be hardware banned instead. At least then you'll need a new NIC to keep your pathetic lying puppet show going.

Not Bitcoin, no. Other cryptos you can mine with a good GPU like 1080ti, but for Bitcoin you need an Antminer. 

&gt; -Can i start doing it without investing ?

No, you need to buy an Antminer, as nobody gives you an Antminer for free. Why would they? Nobody will give you a 1080ti for free. You need to buy these things to mine. 

&gt; -Is there any negative imapacts to my computer or myself ? 

Besides rising electricity bills, no. These bills are payed off long-term via speculation of the price going up from where it's at now. Various different in-browser calculators that will tell you what you will yield per month in terms of crypto vs. cost you have to pay in electricity. 


 &gt; How can i start it ?


Buy an Antminer ASIC or a top-end GPU for your computer. One obviously being cheaper than the other. 

&gt; Is there anything more should i know about it regarding laws etc ?

Depends where you live, but in most cases for the educated world, in terms of laws, no. Nothing to know. Legal in every way possible.

5216	bigfishh	"Monero is probably a good Cryptocurrency to start with. The way you talk about these things alltogether implies you know little of Cryptocurrency.  

Just google the steps yourself and trust me on that Monero thing. The thing is, you can't mine Bitcoin with your 1080ti, because it doesn't generate enough hashing power, to be helpful to the network, as the network is dominated by ASIC-miners ( Antminer ). However Monero ( Cryptocurrency ) is ASIC-resistant and thus the network only uses GPU/CPU mining from normal computers. 


Google : Monero mining pool



It will lead you to many different pools that offer you to mine the currency very easily, with the help of a setup.exe doing everything for you. Not hard to set up, really. 



Now calculator wise, you wanna know some inputs. Again google it yourself. Google: ""Monero profitability calculator"" and put in your values from the pool / your elictricity. 





Finally, don't take this offense really, look up what Monero actually does. Let me give a you small'ish hint, it's essentially pretty similar to Bitcoin actually, but main difference being is that Monero is fully anonymous - Bitcoin isn't. Look it up a little, so you at least know a little, what you are mining. ;)

I’m not worried at one bit about Bitcoin. 

When Bitcoin gets back to it’s ATH and if you bought $50K worth right now, that could become $150K. I might wait a few days to see if it drops further so you’d get in at a better price.

Had I misunderstood earlier, when I assumed that to run a full node with a hardware wallet previously you would:

1) run a Bitcoin Core full node -disable wallet / bitcoind 

2) run an [Electrum Server](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum-server/blob/master/README.md) which would refer to the Bitcoin Core node for block synchronisation and validation 

3) then have an [Electrum client](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/master/README.rst) where you could create a wallet with the private keys generated by your hardware device, and then would direct your client to connect to the Electrum server you are running.

I'm hoping that I might be able to have a wallet client that can directly refer to my own full node (for example like Samourai android wallet) but I can generate keys and sign transactions with my hardware wallet, so I don't need to install a whole intermediary server to accomplish this - which as far as I am aware of, is not possible yet.

So it's very very lightweight, and is compatible with pruning/blocksonly and all the other resource-saving options. Architectures like ElectrumX a quite resource-intensive and so push users towards centralized solutions which destroy their privacy and introduce trust into the system.

&gt; I'm hoping that I might be able to have a wallet client that can directly refer to my own full node (for example like Samourai android wallet) but I can generate keys and sign transactions with my hardware wallet, so I don't need to install a whole intermediary server to accomplish this - which as far as I am aware of, is not possible yet. Though do correct me if I am wrong! 

This is exactly what Electrum Personal Server does. It allows you to connect the Electrum wallet to your own full node, via a very lightweight script."	1522367504.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.026600	dwha5ly	t1_dwh9bxr	/r/Bitcoin/comments/880q54/electrum_personal_server_beta_release/dwha5ly/	3	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	3

One question: Does the pruning also apply to the full node. I.e. I don't have 150 GB free on my VPS, but let's say 20 GB is not a problem.

So yes you can run this even if you don't have much hard disk space. (Although if you ran it on a VPS then the VPS provider can see what all your bitcoin addresses are).

 - Baron Rothschilde 


It's a difficult thing, forcing yourself to buy when the chart looks like a ball bouncing down the stairs and the shorters ramp up the FUD news cycle. I think the sellers will be all [sad panda](https://i2.wp.com/kmshea.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/sad-panda.jpg) later this year, on the tech side, the Lightning Network is poised to be a runaway success. 


Personally I start regular small buys when the [Fear and Greed Index](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/) is under 30, and I switch to small sells when it's over 70. I've done well, YMMV. "	1522372017.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.041099	dwhffq0	t3_881zev	/r/Bitcoin/comments/881zev/scrolling_through_my_blockfolio/dwhffq0/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

5372	BigJim05	It's not just me.  There's been a lot of technical analysis suggesting that bitcoin will bottom on or around March 31st.  This could very well mean the next bull run begins April 1st (Easter).  The much talked about 'death cross' (200 day MA crossing the 50 day MA) is happening about now, but I believe it is more indicative of a bottom than of a bear market.  The fundamentals are too strong.  So if you are stressing out, don't, because this is a sign from God!	1522395067.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.043599	dwi4iog	t1_dwhjte0	/r/Bitcoin/comments/883g9p/bitcoin_might_seem_dead_on_its_death_cross_but/dwi4iog/	0	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	0

5418	carpartsyouneed	"South Korea, Japan, Western countries using their credit cards were driving up the price of BTC. A lot of people were getting loans and borrowing on margins. 

Now that credit card purchases of BTC are banned, loans tapped out, people are cashing out to pay for taxes, and to declare losses.

The next bull run wit be with a populace in trouble with their currency like Zimbabwe or Greece.

BTC got a lot of hype in 2017.  Now we are in a correction. Don’t be surprised BTC at $2000 in 2018.

And as for institutional investors, putting money into BTC is like picking up a cigarette butt. They have enough money to make their own cryptocurrency. They can throw six figure incomes at developers. 

BTC needs to reach critical mass for wide adoption. How about America, Germany, France, and the UK take it on? BTC needs a strong push from at least three wealthy countries to moon and to get thar LAMBO. 

So for now, sit tight, and just wait out this bear market, and don’t be silly and “buy the dip”.  Who came up with that foolish investing advice anyway?’

I’m buying when most of the HODLERS are in panic. Right now I’m just smelling fear. "	1522458830.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.045600	dwjexky	t3_88bw1t	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88bw1t/prices_will_continue_to_fall_until_the_first_of/dwjexky/	-4	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	-4

If 5 billion people did 10 transactions per day, at 250 bytes per transaction, that's ~87 GB blocks. *But* they also want to do microtransactions and machine-machine transactions on the blockchain, **and** have spare capacity for peak times.

Considering their current utilization is ~70KB/block and they're increasing their block size to 32MB this spring, that means (assuming similar ratio of sustained to peak capacity) they'd have to have ~40 TB blocks (or 750 GB blocks based on the current 8MB block size).

Yesterday I bet on the price going down due to low volumes and behavior of traders so I sold at 7.8k and bought back at 6.9k, with a couple of stops and bounces in between.

Today the market seem to be in different shape and more hard to read. Directional bets appear to be more risky at the moment, at least that's my impression. Not sure if bears or bulls might see losses today, could go both ways. For mid-April I am bullish based on the charts from 2017 and 2016, so there might be increasing buying pressure in the air."	1522431551.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.063100	dwitzhb	t1_dwitosd	/r/Bitcoin/comments/8801tu/daily_discussion_march_29_2018/dwitzhb/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

5584	Darkbitsky	"There have been plenty of past pumps in spite of lacking institutional money.

While there are bots and humans trading all the time, at low volumes there's always risk of coordinated traders attempting either drops or pumps. Drops are generally more cost-efficient unless there is decent resistance. It's just hard to extract a particular price range from a complex set of factors.

For the price to drop to a particular point the sellers need to be more eager to sell than the buyers to buy. At lower prices this equation changes, making it hard to predict a potential price range several thousand dollars downwards or upwards.

On the other hand, the benefit of drops and crashes is that newcomers can enter at a better price point, which increase the market. Newcomers coming in at an ATH will generally have a less positive experience."	1522436136.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.063100	dwivvys	t1_dwiva8r	/r/Bitcoin/comments/8801tu/daily_discussion_march_29_2018/dwivvys/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

5611	jdgcrypto	"Sounds like a terrible idea for a number of reasons. 

1. If you did not think it was a good idea to sell BTC at 15 or 10K why do you think it is a good idea now at 7K? Makes no sense at all.

2. The bottom of BTC was at USD 6000. Now it is rebounding from 6600. This could well be a higher bottom. Certainly looking at the candle stick that is forming today, the chance you sell at the lowest point is much greater than the chance that BTC drops through the 6000 USD support level.

3. Trying to time the bottom is expensive. The only way to do it is to be on top of your computer all day. Likelyhood is you get out now, you look again a day later, or the next morning, and BTC is back at 9000. This is how fast recoveries tend to go. I do not have the time and energy to be on top of the price 24/7 to avoid buying back more expensive.

4. With regulation on the way, more and more institutional investors are looking at cryptos. For instance the 500M crypto hedgefund of Mark Yusko. But many others big players, including Blackrock are preparing to invest in bitcoin and possibly other cryptos. Once they get in it is going to go crazy. This could start tomorrow, next week, next month or in June or so. I am not risking missing the boom or having to buy back higher.

In short, if you believe BTC has no future. Sell now. If you think it has, this is a time to buy, not to sell.
In January it was a good time to sell. The basics of investing continue to be the same: buy low, sell high. Not the opposite."	1522431411.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.063599	dwitxgu	t1_dwiqtzn	/r/Bitcoin/comments/8801tu/daily_discussion_march_29_2018/dwitxgu/	2	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	2

If it is clear that more downside is likely then when not simply convert to your local currency and buy back in at a lower price? Currently there has been a slight bounce. I am going to see how far this goes. However, if we see the price touch the point it bounced at again and then breakdown below it, I will sell.

Im a believer in bitcoin, and im down with the whole HODL community

but wouldnt taking a profit, and buying back in cheaper be the more logical financial move?  
Timing the market is a b!tch, but aside from that I would have been more than happy to have cashed out at the ATH, then bought back in with a way bigger position with todays price"	1522472087.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.063599	dwjse0w	t1_dwistol	/r/Bitcoin/comments/8801tu/daily_discussion_march_29_2018/dwjse0w/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

I think more upside is likely after the correction we had and just above the bottom of early February (USD 6000).

5616	SmokingHorsey	"I think more downside is likely because we are in a bear market. In a bear market downside is the trend. People have been saying it is quite likely we’ve seen the bottom for months now. 

There is no reason to think the bottom has occurred until there is some kind of real turn around. I agree with you that it’s always a risk. Yes, you could sell now and then the turn around occurs causing you to buy at a higher price. But that’s why I said to wait until something confirms the price is going lower first. 

If the price breaks down below 6k you can be assured that panic selling will occur and it will start dropping like a stone. We’ll just need to wait and see I guess."	1522448640.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.063599	dwj4da8	t1_dwitzrv	/r/Bitcoin/comments/8801tu/daily_discussion_march_29_2018/dwj4da8/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

5622	WhyDontYouTryIt	"To be honest: nobody can give you solid advice in this matter. 

- It might be that the dip is over the moment you sold and you have to buy back later at a higher price.

- It might be that you decide not to sell, because of the previous possibility, but the price continues to drop.

Personally, I had my target at around 6800. I bought some more. But that might have been a mistake.

This is, why I had my target there:

Doesn't this pose a major problem for Bitcoin / the broader crypto ecosystem existing at the mercy of centralized authorities like governments? Either you use a centralized exchange and get KYC'd to the point where all the activities of your coins are subject to regulatory scrutiny / surveillance, or you use decentralized exchanges and face the risks described here. This really saps a lot of the economic sovereignty that cryptocommerce is supposed to empower users with.

5763	Ttatt1984	"the greater fool theory is not indicative of a bubble destined to crash and go to zero. Although it’s true that when it comes to investing, the obvious rule is to buy low ahead of others who will surely realize their mistake in not buying and who will then buy later at higher prices, thus pushing prices even higher which will compel others to buy as well. 

However..... that’s what a market is. In almost every aspect, we pay the price today because either we want it today or we’re afraid it’ll cost more tomorrow. When it comes to investing, we buy today because we perceive that it’s value today is not equal to the value we see it will get to in the future. That’s why property goes up in value over time. The potential for property to be used to generate better returns in the future causes a buyer to buy it today. And since property is not an infinite resource, its value goes up over time. 

With bitcoin, those of us buying low today are doing so because we believe in the technology that hasn’t become widespread yet. Barely 1% of the world’s population is using it. And yet the technology is improving so it can be prepared to scale for when we get to 5 or even 10% of adoption in a few years. And since bitcoin’s purpose is to serve the underserved, the unbanked millions out there, we still have ample room to grow.

The greater fool theory may seem to apply to bitcoin recently since yes, it is true, speculators became involved in the market and drove prices higher. But now with depressed price levels we are seeing, speculators can be expected to leave the market and now we can see healthy slow and steady price appreciation.

5764	infectedant	"Ok let's assume the best and say that there is a steady price appreciation, that itself would not be a desirable aspect in a currency. In order for a stable and sustainable economy, money velocity needs to be relatively high and stay high. With a steady appreciating asset, it would not be a viable currency. If you know the money you get is going to be worth more in the future, there is no incentive to spend. Aiming for a steady price appreciation is once again looking at bitcoin like a commodity or an investment rather than a currency. There's a reason the FED aims for an average of 2% inflation, so people have an incentive to spend the money they have. Without that, a deflationary spiral can crash the entire value of the currency.

Let's ignore that for now to address another issue. In a completely bitcoin economy, there still must be lenders to lend out bitcoin for businesses to invest or government to spend. For lack of a better term let's call these lending bodies banks which charge an interest rate for lending. If there was a sudden shock to the economy that greatly increases the demand for bitcoin as an asset to hold, the interest rates go up. This would cause an decrease in the inflation rateof the currency, and once again the same issue is faced (along with additional issues such as higher unemployment and a lower gross domestic product) The only difference is the FED can change the money supply of fiat money, but their hands are tied with bitcoin. They cannot take any measures to ease the shock and the economy is out of control, literally because nobody can do anything to control it.

5765	Ttatt1984	"I was just about to go to sleep and then your post woke me right up. 

With that said, I have to ask, in that scenario, what exactly could cause such a shock that would increase demand for bitcoin? If it’s a debt-caused shock, that would be because too much bitcoin was lent out and now the borrowers can’t pay back? Who would be increasing demand? The banks or lenders? 

Anyway... as I ponder on those scenarios, I think I should be clear that bitcoin is not intended to be the only cryptocurrency in the world. It’s the first of its kind and it fulfills it’s purpose of being a decentralized transmitter of value. It can be used as a medium of exchange but I don’t believe it was meant to be the single world economy currency. For the reasons you laid out, it can’t be. 

However, bitcoin’s continued existence would prove that a decentralized system of cryptocurrencies is possible in an increasingly tech-driven digital economy. Other coins and protocols could be built on top of bitcoin (or separately) that could fulfill other purposes. For example, we could have an slow and steady inflationary crypto to power the spending economy. 

Although we don’t hear about them much, there are projects in development where multiple coins and chains could be transacted at the same time. Things like coin-joins and atomic swaps are going to happen. Envision a cryptocurrency economy where there are various coins for varying purposes, but all relying on a bitcoin base layer as it’s security. 

Imagine you and I doing business with two different cryptocoins. Each can have some of its value tied to bitcoin in some manner allowing you and I to exchange a product with our respective coin while relying on the bitcoin base layer. That’s actually possible today though it requires other cryptos to mature before it’s more widely used. 

Basically.... although my comment history might make me seem like a bitcoin maximalist... I’m really not. I believe bitcoin is the first of many protocols to come into maturity, all of which will prove that value can be transacted without central bank middlemen.

For the vast majority of people, it is an investment instrument rather than a currency. If gold was as volatile as bitcoin is right now, many more people would be supporting gold instead. As soon as the volatility dies down (which it must as a currency, no stable currency can have this amount of volatility to sustain an able economy), wouldn't all the ""greater fools"" jump ship. Then what you would be left with is a low value online currency with no way to change the supply of money in the economy, making the currency itself unable to self correct inflationary or recessionary gaps, with only a core few using it.

The greater fool theory states that the price of an object is determined not by its intrinsic value, but rather by irrational beliefs and expectations of market participants.

In other words, one may pay a price that seems ""foolishly"" high because one may rationally have the expectation that the item can be resold to a ""greater fool"" later."	1522538661.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.203117	dwkzc8d	t1_dwjy6a5	/r/Bitcoin/comments/888lkb/please_dont_get_mad_at_me_for_asking_this/dwkzc8d/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

* You would, however, benefit from accepting Bitcoin by eliminating any fraud and chargeback risk. This risk also differs by business type; it is very low in typical face-to-face small business retail, so eliminating it may not actually save you all that much either.
* While cash does have zero built-in fees, it's not free to process. You run the risk of getting robbed. You may have to pay for cash pick up by a security service or drive to the bank yourself every day. Some banks charge fees for large deposits in coins and small bills.
* Adoption is driven by consumers more than businesses. Consumers ask to pay by card because they get cash-back, miles, points. And because they can [spend money they don't have](http://time.com/money/4607838/household-credit-card-debt/). Businesses provide what consumers ask for. Of course, the consumer pays for the cash-back/miles/points ""savings"" several times over in higher prices, but most don't think that far. Also, you usually don't get a discount for paying cash, so may as well swipe the card - hence reinforcing the card as preferred payment method. A sinister circle exploiting human psychology, fully intentionally set up that way by the credit card industry. Bitcoin can't replicate that until we can wean ourselves off the silly cash-back habit.

5838	dieselapa	"It doesn't really work like that. Every form of payment has costs attached to them, both for the paying party and the receiving party. For the paying party it can be fees for having accounts and credit cards at your bank, or withdrawal fees from ATMs, and the like. For Bitcoin it can be conversion costs and spread, wire transfer fees, and UTXO consolidation transaction fees.

But let's ignore the payer's costs for now, because there can be other reasons that they have this payment option, which means that they don't view them as costs for this particular purchase.

Credit cards and debit cards have different costs in different countries, and they definitely have different costs for different market actors. Large corporations can negotiate much better terms with Visa and Mastercard, for example. But for cash to be a better alternative, you still have to account for all the cash handling and the risk of theft and robbery.

In many cases it's also not a simple question of only accepting the most profitable means of payment, because some customers prefer one form over another, regardless of what you would prefer they pay in, resulting in loss of trade if you don't supply their preferred means of payment.

On the surface, accepting bitcoins as payment should be a good deal for merchants, as there is no risk of charge backs. But there is a large initial cost of implementing a new payment option, and then there are overhead costs of maintaining it. Therefore, you have to expect significant volume to consider implementing it, and actually have at least decent volume to maintain it once it's been implemented.

Many have done this in a ""subsidized"" way, by using it as a marketing tool, and by externalizing the receiving party's transaction cost on the payer. Bitcoin as a means of payment has a bit of a problem getting started, as you need users for companies to accept it as payment, but you also need use cases for people to start using it. With that in mind, any use case is better than it not existing, as it may at least attract those for which it is extra appealing, despite having to eat the receiving party's costs. It could be one of the things that gets the ball rolling. For it to grow larger it will have to move away from this model eventually. When there is large enough demand from customers to be able to pay in Bitcoin, and merchants are more appreciative of the benefits of receiving immutable transactions instantly, then I think we will start to see a rather fast shift towards more Bitcoin payments. This will bring larger trading volumes as well, which will lower both conversion costs and spread. There will also be better solutions for accounting and point of sale systems, and companies handling all or parts of the transaction supply chain. These are some of the many network effects that have grown the Bitcoin use and price exponentially for many years.

Regular Bitcoin transactions have had many years to try to break into the market of everyday purchases, with very limited success. Lightning network will add significant complexity to the system, and will have some growing pains, but will eventually bring such significant benefits to transaction speed and cost, that it will be what causes an exponential breakthrough of usage, in my opinion."	1522350564.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.211098	dwgv3l2	t3_87ydxa	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87ydxa/from_a_small_business_perspective_if_the_purchase/dwgv3l2/	3	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	3

All I stated was the absolute fact that, using the numbers provided to me by OP and /u/bee8e3713e555a27037a, a flat 5% charge is better than a 2% charge plus $0.30 for a $4 transaction, as described by OP.

You are looking into this way too much and picking fights that don't exist. I am not stating the whole world should switch to Bitcoin as we have many hurdles to overcome before then, namely:

* Providing legislation, insurance and other bureaucratic elements to provide insured custodial accounts for people who do not wish to be ""their own bank"" (and take on all the risks that imposes)
* Upping the rate of transactions for global transactions with some sort of scalable system (Lightning looks promising at the moment)
* Somehow legislating and creating a credit system so people who currently rely on mortgages and credit cards can continue use with Bitcoin
* Working on improving the privacy of Bitcoin

So no, I don't believe that suddenly all coffee shops should take Bitcoin. I think that some should, yes, but only if the owners and customers understand what they're getting into, but you're jumping into this very ""me vs them"" and anyone who does not fully agree with you is the ""opposition"" and you must ""prove them wrong"".

5874	fresheneesz	The only case you'd have to worry about is if the hard fork makes the commitment transactions invalid, which is unlikely since backwards compatibility for transactions is both easy to do and causes chaos if not done. If support for a type of transaction is removed, there will likely be years of notice so everyone will have enough time to update their software and channel states.	1522372297.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.214600	dwhfrjg	t3_8818dn	/r/Bitcoin/comments/8818dn/lightning_and_hf/dwhfrjg/	6	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	6
5875	coinfacemoron	"I think the answer is a bit more complicated. This is my take, but I could be misunderstood.

In the case of lightning, open channels will just pass around commitment transactions that are not broadcast to the main chain until the channel is supposed to settle (close). If a hard fork occurs on the network before settlement, you also need to consider if the hard fork does implements replay protection. If it does, then previous commitments txs are valid on both chains, and could be broadcast on both (which is messy), and also the fork may not be monitored properly for broadcasting previous state (trying to steal), so it may be wise to close the fork channel. 

If the hard fork does implement reply protection, the original channel could remain open on the original fork and transactions in the lightning channel would continue to be valid. On the forked chain, previous commitment transactions would now be invalid, and the channel would have to close and reopen."	1522362337.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.214600	dwh4e5q	t3_8818dn	/r/Bitcoin/comments/8818dn/lightning_and_hf/dwh4e5q/	3	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	3

5878	kekcoin	"Well, no, nothing of that nature has been implemented (because obviously devs aren't going to focus on that until it becomes relevant when there are far more relevant problems to solve), but I'm talking hypothetically here.

Hypothetically you could follow both chains after the fork in a similar manner to how cross-chain atomic swaps need a LN node that is aware of multiple blockchains. What you would need to do is, before the chain forks, generate two ""states""; a primary state that is valid on the current chain and the post-fork chain that follows current rules (but not on the chain with the new rules), and a shadow state that is valid on the post-fork chain that follows the new rules (but not on the current chain or the post-fork chain that follows the current rules). These states should have distinct revocation secrets.

Both of these parallel states would need to be revoked every time such a channel is updated before the fork, but AFTER the fork, these channels are essentially two channels on the different chains, and should be treated individually.

If you have a channel with a channel partner that does not run a version of LN that is capable of doing this (or she does and you don't want to run it yourself), the channel should be closed BEFORE the fork occurs."	1522376607.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.214600	dwhkrij	t1_dwhie50	/r/Bitcoin/comments/8818dn/lightning_and_hf/dwhkrij/	5	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	5

Not gonna lie, my first time when I heard about exchangee and these greenn volatiliity I invested in shitc0in they didn’t had t0kens at the time and I lost my BTC value. Unlike Bitcoin I never used or even withdrew these shitc0ins beside tradiing them on exchange. Alot of noobs joined the space lately and invest in shitc0in expecting they would be worth more than bitcoin This will never happen and this is one reason that impacted bitcoin to drop, so y’all can understand that **Bitcoin is the only true internet currency**, the rest is all shitcoin and will forever be Pomp and Domp to increase your bitcoin value. **Bitcoin 25K+ EOY**

Carefull about shitc0ins, mostly lately with ethareum platform its even more easy to create shitc0in, these **t0kens are all shit** and created within a minute, and its creators launch a fancy website and request funds only to enrich themself and y’all noobs easely fall for it.

“Any protocol” that can solve bitcoin’s pain points will NOT rocket past it because it will not be able to do do what bitcoin has proven in 10 years: it is resilient and anti fragile.

The elegant feature about bitcoin is that in addition to proof of work, it also has amassed a length of actual time where it has proven itself. 

A “better” protocol would have to prove itself and earn its stripes against the jungle of the market. That can’t be done in less than 10 years. Even if a new coin/protocol came out now with supposedly better features, it will not have been tested nor will it have endured 10 years of attacks to its integrity. And let’s say this new protocol survives 10 years or so. Wouldn’t that mean bitcoin will have survived 20 years? And during that time, it will have gained other layers of technology and infrastructure built upon it which will make it the most secure and proven protocol. 

I would argue that developers ought to move slower because bitcoin does not yet have the widespread adoption globally. If this protocol is to become the global standard, it needs to be done right and quality cannot be rushed. 

Above all else, developers ought to focus on keeping the network secure, decentralized, with sufficient layers and features for privacy and anonymity. Buying coffee is not as important as having a system of storing and transferring value be secure and stable.

6049	xxDan_Evansxx	"Other coins may prove super useful for certain use cases.  Some may immediately be significantly better than Bitcoin for certain things and may find rapid adoption and price growth.

That doesn't mean Bitcoin will become irrelevant though.  There will always be value placed on the coin which is the most decentralized, and that quality in Bitcoin is almost impossible to replicate with some new centralized project.  It would take a long time.  Also difficult to beat will be the perceived security (and actual security) of Bitcoin due to its longest history.  The genesis of Bitcoin is unique and really can never be repeated.  It makes a lot of sense to have at least one long term crypto ledger which remains in place because of the trust people have in its history, not because of the tech specs or new bells and whistles."	1522328833.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.257598	dwgkpz2	t1_dwgiejp	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87vu67/tom_lee_on_cnbc_fast_money_march_28_2018/dwgkpz2/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

Take an amount of money you'd be okay with wasting on lottery tickets in a year, and put that slowly into Bitcoin. Buy that much each year and see if things work. Avoid lottery tickets and try to find other areas in your life to cut expenses to fund this investment.

6093	chrisrico	"&gt;There's no way a merchant wants to accept an unconfirmed RBF transaction. Yes, it really does make double spending a breeze.

If someone tries to double spend using RBF, there's a clever technique a merchant could use called Scorched Earth. Dependent transactions are considered when calculating fees for replacement, so when a merchant software sees a transaction replaced in the mempool, they

1. Cancel the order, if possible
2. Spend the *replaced* transaction, but with no valued outputs (can't have 0 outputs but you can have a single OP_RETURN)

This means that the dependent transaction's funds go *entirely* to miners' fees, increasing the total fees of the combined pair of transactions and preventing any further replacement by the attacker.

I don't think this is at all used today, most merchants just wait for RBF to confirm. If it were used though, just the threat of it would deter double spending attempts using RBF. There's still no way to prevent a miner from colluding with the double spender though, so 0 conf will never be *safe*."	1522365480.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.262101	dwh7tjk	t1_dwgzl4f	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87z0r3/a_warning_to_everyone_that_decide_to_spent/dwh7tjk/	2	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	2

Hierarchical deterministic wallets and extended public keys. The server only ever has the xpub, which allows it to generate a sequence of public keys matching private keys generated by the xprv.

The benefit with middle man services are the handling of exchange towards other assets,  such as I can accept every currency,  but I want it converted to for instance only Bitcoin.

Trading is a two-sides thing, if someone is stupid enough that he/she would call(buy)/put(sell) in the future market at a price higher/lower than the current market rather than biding(buy)/asking(sell) in the current market, the other party earns the price difference by hodling the contract until expiration day."	1522455406.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.407603	dwjbaf7	t1_dwj23n7	/r/Bitcoin/comments/887g6s/why_do_bitcoin_future_even_exist/dwjbaf7/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

The other part is harder. Does Valve have a native (to steam) LN payment system? How will valve get their $? Will we have to go through a 3rd party payment system like Bitpay again? 
Ideally (for me) they would implement it in the steam client, so it doesn't need to be outsourced to another website (like paypal / bitpay) and simply show you a barcode to scan.

I'm thinking of general retail, so that includes Steam games, corner shops, bars in clubs, ticket machines, supermarkets etc. 
I don't think Ethereum's 15s block time is fast enough for those cases either. (Variance means some times there is a 1m+ wait before confirmation, which is a no-go for retail).
  
As a fun anecdotal reference, people used to moan when you paid by card in a pub, cards used to be much slower than cash and you'd be holding the queue up by insisting on paying by card. With widespread Contactless payments in the UK the tables have turned. Contactless is faster than cash.

If you're only sending, the prior states would always represent a worse state for the other party to the channel, so he has no reason to try and broadcast any of the old states. This way, you can be offline indefinitely without the risk of funds loss.

Eventually, this will be resolved with watchtowers. Your wallet would contact several different watchtower services and have them watch the chain for cheating attempts. If they catch a cheating attempt and respond on your behalf, they get a fee."	1522315076.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.423602	dwg9dp1	t1_dwg2t9u	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87v5dx/acinq_releases_eclair_lightning_wallet_beta_on/dwg9dp1/	8	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	8

6276	chrisrico	"I didn't realize they were talking about the Android version. It's send only because a mobile wallet won't be connected and watching the blockchain all the time. In order to protect against the channel's other node cheating, it has to watch the blockchain. There is a planned extension called ""Watchtower"" that allows you to outsource this blockchain watching with little to no trust. Once that is developed, we'll probably see mobile Lightning wallets allow receiving.

You don't need to worry about cheating when you're *only* sending because each channel state is more advantageous to the other node, and they'll never try to cheat by settling an old channel state."	1522322608.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.424101	dwgg2gf	t1_dwgfaho	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87v5dx/acinq_releases_eclair_lightning_wallet_beta_on/dwgg2gf/	2	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	2

this is true but the reason is just that new ATH -&gt; new news -&gt; more people read about bitcoin -&gt; more people google bitcoin -&gt; next ATH.

It can't. Perhaps it could facilitate (via atomic swaps) using a decentralized naming system built on a sidechain?

1. Who is 'we all'? Don't speak for others, only for yourself.

2. What is 'most probably'? Is it the range between 80%-90%? or anything above 60%? This is EXACTLY why we have statistics, so that we can quantify uncertainty without using vague words like 'very likely' or 'most probably'. Also, if you choose to use statistical averages, don't forget to mention standard deviations.

3. I take the use of language very seriously. Most conflicts/arguments are caused by the improper use of language, which causes individuals to misunderstand each other.

'Character assassination is an attempt to tarnish a person's reputation. It may involve exaggeration, misleading half-truths, or manipulation of facts to present an untrue picture of the targeted person. It is a form of defamation and can be a form of ad hominem argument.'

""exaggeration, misleading half-truths""
Almost everything i see is an exaggeration, but sure it have some truth, even when he got arrested for selling fireworks, i saw a lot of exaggeration.

Now every single person at BCH, first ""they are in charge"" of the coin, second they are all criminals and scammers, the only thing i can say is thank god Mcafee is not considered ""in charge"" of BCH, i read some histories about him since he made a youtube video ""How To Uninstall McAfee Antivirus"" ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKgf5PaBzyg ) which i found funny at some years ago, but his stories would suit this propaganda? , but everyone would be welcome, i don't have to agree with any of them or be a friend to them.

In this ""proof"", realistic thinking, i see an employee of Roger that used duplicated accounts on twitter, but obviously it can be worst than that, but do we really know ?

Everyone has flaws, if you see a movie on internet you are a criminal, if you drive at more 5 miles than the allowed speed, you are breaking the law, that do not means i go to the internet telling others that you are very dangerous for every people alive, it really depends on situations and what you really did.

Look at this example too:
https://elpais.com/elpais/2018/02/21/inenglish/1519204313_494974.html

He got 3 years in prison for speaking. That's recent too.

Really, the question is how /r/Bitcoin should handle such deceitful spammers. In most cases we just ban them, but the mod team has actually given Roger's team **extraordinary leniency** so as not to feed his narrative that he's a victim.

Given the metric ton of alt coin spam being levied at r/bitcoin, coupled with the meteoric growth in subscribers... mods need all the help they can picking it up.

If there's any doubt that bch is an alt, let us remember even Jihan (one of its chief proponents) asked via a tweet that bch stop trying to be bitcoin, cementing its alt coin status.  

Which is fine... there's room for bch (as an alt) as soon as supporters learn their best way of finding their niche is through atomic swaps, and embracing the will of the economic (and scientific!) majority who, along with Jihan, well and truly settled this 'debate' many moons ago.

6516	garybitcoincom	"&gt;Roger has said on several occasions, very loudly and sometimes while waving his middle finger at the camera, that he absolutely does not employ sockpuppet accounts of any kind.

Indeed, and neither he nor the site he runs, pays people to use sockpuppets to push agendas, etc.

What an employee -
 who is employed as a news writer - does of their own volition is their own concern.

You are conflating the actions of one person (Jamie) with another (Roger). Jamie is not paid to sockpuppet, he is paid as a journalist. If he chooses to sockpuppet that is his own issue and anyone can rightly call him out on it, but equating it to Roger employing someone **as** a sockpuppet is ridiculous.

To use an analogy:
You work at a bookstore and the manager employs you as a teller to work the cash register. You are employed by him/her to do that job.

You take it upon yourself to write favourable reviews of some books and critical reviews of others. You are not employed to do that, but if we use the logic you are applying to this situation then the manager has employed you to write reviews.

They have not. They have employed you to work on the cash register, and you have taken it upon yourself to write the book reviews. You are an employee of the bookshop, but your actions in writing book reviews outside the scope of your cash register job are your own thing. They have nothing to do with the bookstore, and they have nothing to do with your manager. They are **your own** actions."	1522302145.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.461600	dwfxad6	t3_87t3ot	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87t3ot/delicious_proof_that_roger_employs_sockpuppets/dwfxad6/	0	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	0

6520	garybitcoincom	"Most of you don't know Roger very well, and a lot of what is written about him is coloured by 'Bitcoin civil war politics', for lack of a better term.

To answer your question, first off I should state that I consider Roger a very good friend first and foremost, and he's one of the very few people who has earned my complete trust through his actions.

If you took the time to get to know Roger you'd quickly find that he's quite frankly one of the most genuine, kind and rational people you'll ever meet. He possesses absolutely no malice and that's a quality that is quite rare in today's 'dog-eat-dog' world. I've been supported by his friendship through some incredibly tough times in my life - indeed that continues to this day - and he has been there for me despite how incredibly busy he always is; most importantly, he has done this without asking anything in return. He has earned my friendship and my absolute respect, two things which must always be earned.

Aside from the fact that we are both also anarcho-capitalists and share pretty much the exact same views on everything (which certainly does help people get along), the reason we both got involved in Bitcoin was because we both saw its huge potential to provide economic freedom to every single individual on the planet, and its promise as a means of regaining individual liberties by limiting the power of governments

The politics behind the above is all a discussion for a different forum/subreddit, of course, but to cut it relatively short: Roger's not in this to become a 'leader' or a 'notable figure' of any sort, and he's certainly not in it just to make money - it's no secret that he doesn't need to do that; he's in this to help further Bitcoin's promise of liberating individuals, limiting the power of governments to control those individuals and giving everyone in the world an equal opportunity to engage in free, voluntary trades.

Spend some time actually talking to Roger if you ever get the chance; I can guarantee that you'll quickly realise how wrong the people slating his character are."	1522346032.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.461600	dwgsxwg	t1_dwgnlm8	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87t3ot/delicious_proof_that_roger_employs_sockpuppets/dwgsxwg/	0	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	0
6521	thieflar	"Roger Ver is a serial liar. A while ago I compiled together a [non-comprehensive list of examples of his lies](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6xpu8j/roger_ver_lies/dmhsmc3/), which included things like claiming to be banned from a subreddit he wasn't actually banned in (and then accidentally posting in it), egregiously misrepresenting his trial (which has a public court transcript available to contrast against), the infamous case where he vouched for Mt.Gox shortly before it imploded, and actions/policies he has taken with regards to the website(s) he controls.


In a classic case of psychological projection, Roger Ver told [a string of lies](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/61r678/rogers_latest_lie_is_out_on_twitter_acuses_aaron/dfhe7r3/) while accusing Aaron van Wirdum of being a liar.


As you can see from the thread above, Roger is often presented information which he deliberately chooses to ignore or suppress. Another excellent example of this is the case where [a single user went out of their way to vandalize a subreddit](https://twitter.com/StopAndDecrypt/status/933174301045469184) (which was repeatedly explained to Roger), and then Roger tried to [misrepresent the episode anyway](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7jax1o/i_roger_ver_will_be_doing_an_ama_on_monday_dec/). Yet another example of this is when Roger [flagrantly misrepresented history](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/825icd/in_2013_everyone_knew_that_bitcoin_could_scale_to/dv96bxf/) and was promptly made aware of how disingenous his depiction was, only to record [a video two days later which repeated (and doubled down on) the very same lie](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/82xdjm/censored_see_the_video_that_core_supporters_had/dvdsjrh/) (as well as making more untruthful statements). Note that Roger conspicuously refuses to respond to or acknowledge the facts of the matter when they are brought to his attention; [here's another example of him doing the same thing after making an unsubstantiated claim](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7zpzh7/what_i_roger_ver_think_about_op_group/duqw6q5/?context=3) (on a related note, if you were wondering what I was referring to in the first paragraph of the previous link, see [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7dlyk4/censorship/duaqgxb/); this well-documented political overmoderation/censorship of rbtc is another subject I've been trying to ask Roger about and only ever get crickets in response).


On a more ""silly"" and ""minor"" note, he likes to make misleading post titles like ""[What I (Roger Ver) think about OP_GROUP](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7zpzh7/what_i_roger_ver_think_about_op_group/)"" without actually saying what he thinks about the proposal (instead engaging in a blatant bait-and-switch where he goes on to make more lies about how their community has ""free and open discussion"" despite the fact that this is false; see the preceding paragraph to get a fuller picture and appreciation of this). On an unrelated-to-crypto note, he has gone out of his way to [defend dogfighting](https://np.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/85ifdc/convicted_dog_fighter_on_f2w/dvyc5sr/), which isn't ""dishonest"" per se, but is reprehensible in another way.


He frequently makes directly-contradictory statements, like when he said [""I've dumped a few hundred BTC for BCC"" and then two weeks later said ""I haven't cashed a single Bitcoin, or altcoin, or cash, or anything for Bitcoin Cash up until yesterday, and I sold like about a dozen Bitcoins for Bitcoin Cash.""](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7fmvix/when_you_invite_someone_to_do_a_video_interview/dqdc44h/) Note that even when he makes statements like this (which *cannot* both be true) he will sometimes try to retroactively qualify one or the other in an attempt at further deception; this represents [more lying](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7fmvix/when_you_invite_someone_to_do_a_video_interview/dqdh3ff/). In the same vein, his mining pool [signals support for BIPs that it doesn't enforce](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4zqd7g/roger_ver_does_your_bitcoin_classic_pool_on/).


He repeatedly pushes the false (and destructively misleading) propaganda that ""Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin"" and ""Bitcoin is Bitcoin Cash""; not only will he resort to [extremely childish images](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7jatfn/conclusion_bitcoin_cash_is_bitcoin/) in the name of this cause (and [repeat the tactic like a broken record](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7w6rnp/reminder_bitcoin_cash_is_effectively_bitcoin/)), but [effectively sponsors it on the bitcoin(dot)com website and the rbtc subreddit (both of which he controls)](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7vw43m/bch_is_apparently_a_scam_according_to_rbitcoin/dtwxbe7/)... to put the icing on the cake, the website was involved in [a ""bitter dispute"" between Ver and OKCoin which resulted from Ver's ""suspicious activity""](https://bravenewcoin.com/news/roger-ver-revealed-as-bitcoin-com-owner-in-bitter-dispute-with-okcoin/) and [he most likely bought the subreddit in an under-the-table deal in direct violation of reddit's Terms-of-Service](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/84djb8/did_theymos_purchase_rbitcoin_in_2011/dvp8nmi/).


There are other times where his lies and misrepresentations are more subtle. [Take this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8385wt/blockstreams_former_cto_on_bitcoin_cash/), for instance; not only is he purposefully misconstruing a quote (which he apparently doesn't even understand the underlying logic of) and pretending that it is referencing an asset *which didn't even exist at the time*, but in the image/slide Roger created, he includes a screenshot of a **BitPay service fee** as if it is a **Bitcoin network fee** during a time period in which Bitcoin transactions using *1 cent fees* were being processed. It's almost impressive *how much* duplicity Roger was able to cram into a single slide.


Another ridiculous misrepresentation he tried to get away with was the time where he mocked Andreas Antonopoulos on Twitter, and then had the gall to [later claim he ""made Andreas a millionaire""](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7kf43b/bitcoincom_wallet_2_out_of_5_stars_531_ratings_we/drei7jx/), essentially trying to take personal credit for the donations that the community (and especially @Tether_is_Fiat) provided.


He will [relentlessly promote the known scammer Craig Wright](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7r9ex7/craig_wright_dishes_out_the_truth_on_the_crypto/), promoting links like [this one](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/82axqt/craig_having_shown_me_privately_and_two_of_the/) (where it is claimed that Craig Wright is Satoshi and has possession of Satoshi's private keys) while saying things like [""In regards to me saying that Craig Wright is Satoshi, uh, **I have never said that publicly**""](https://youtu.be/E97g-zbR0aU?t=1113). 


As part of his propaganda campaign, he'll shamelessly repeat untrue headlines like [""Bitcoin cash is surging as other cryptocurrencies fall""](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7y7fgj/bitcoin_cash_is_surging_as_other_cryptocurrencies/) when the reality of the situation is that [most of the time, exchanging your BCH for BTC would have been far more profitable than not doing so](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/823zvv/the_funniest_thing_about_core_trolls_that_i_dont/dv93x53/), and this has proven more and more true as time has gone on (another fact Roger refuses to ever concede).


He will [reference fake projects](https://youtu.be/E97g-zbR0aU?t=831) (which [do not exist, and represent nothing more than misinformation for trolls to parrot](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/848gbk/rbitcoin_on_boycotts/dvohhq3/)) and gets [*extremely* emotional and irrationally upset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCOjCEth6xI) when people use the phrase ""bcash"" to refer to BCH (despite being willing to repeatedly and aggressively misrepresent ""Bitcoin"" as ""Bitcoin Core"", even though the former is a network and asset and the latter is a software client and node implementation). Note that the video link just provided includes Roger Ver ""rage quitting"" from the interview with the quote: ""I've never hired a single sockpuppet"" which [has now been proven to be *another* false statement](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/87t3ot/delicious_proof_that_roger_employs_sockpuppets/).


A long time ago, he also [abused his admin rights on blockchain(dot)info to dox (and fully publish) a user's information](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/76u1ft/that_one_time_roger_ver_abused_his_administrator/) over a *$50 dispute* which was the result of *Roger accidentally sending the user BTC* and which had *nothing to do with blockchain(dot)info in the first place*. When the community lambasted him for this (obviously unethical) behavior, he locked and edited the thread to try to cover it up and sweep it under the rug. Fortunately for us (and unfortunately for Roger's reputation), the incident is archived.


This isn't a comprehensive breakdown, either. [Others have compiled](https://decentralize.today/roger-ver-lies-f5333e152858) similar [histories](https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@gank/the-truth-about-roger-ver-and-bch-and-why-you-and-your-usd-should-stay-away) of [Roger Ver lying](https://medium.com/@WhalePanda/roger-ver-from-bitcoin-jesus-to-bitcoin-antichrist-69fc7a17c622), and even *those* don't cover everything. There are tons of other examples where Roger Ver showed the world his true colors, and **they are ugly**."	1522362571.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.461600	dwh4n51	t1_dwgsxwg	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87t3ot/delicious_proof_that_roger_employs_sockpuppets/dwh4n51/	3	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	3

6523	thieflar	"&gt;If you took the time to get to know Roger you'd quickly find that he's quite frankly one of the most genuine, kind and rational people you'll ever meet.

This is false. Having spent *a lot* of time getting to know Roger, I can say with certainty that the opposite is the case.

He is a proven liar. I myself have caught him lying (and proven that he was deliberately doing so) on numerous separate occasions. When I compile the proof together and ask him for comment, he invariably stops responding, no matter how politely I phrase the inquiry. These days, I have generally stopped going out of my way to be overly polite, and simply point out the disinformation and falsehoods directly; he predictably refuses to respond (at least on his main account).

&gt;He possesses absolutely no malice

This is similarly false.

&gt;Spend some time actually talking to Roger if you ever get the chance

Unfortunately, if you are well-informed and a principled human being, you'll likely never get that chance, because Roger refuses to engage in honest dialogue with such people. Sometimes he'll ""debate"" with knowledgeable people, but his end invariably consists of talking-point repetition (no matter how contextually irrelevant) and lowest-common-denominator emotional appeals which almost always just serve as subject changes and distractions.

&gt;I can guarantee that you'll quickly realise how wrong the people slating his character are.

As someone who has spent a considerable amount of time **proving**, with absolutely no room for ambiguity, that Roger is a willing and enthusiastic liar (who seems to be motivated by greed and megalomania more than any sort of altruism or nobility), I can tell you that this statement is objectively false. At this point, there is a **long** list of instances wherein Roger has deliberately lied to push forward his own personal agenda(s); as an employee who is literally paid to further his agenda, you are (of course) going to obstinately refuse to acknowledge anything on the list, but that doesn't mean anything other than that *you* are a deceptive and immoral person, too.

It is a sad fact that Roger is an immoral liar and an enemy of Bitcoin (as both a network and a movement). It is even more unfortunate how well-funded he is, and how willing he is to eschew anything resembling principles or integrity in the name of furthering his own personal interests."	1522348167.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.462099	dwgtw8d	t1_dwgsxwg	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87t3ot/delicious_proof_that_roger_employs_sockpuppets/dwgtw8d/	2	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	2

6545	dalebewan	"&gt; I’m new to bitcoin, I’ve tried to read articles but it’s still a bit confusing.

It can be.  It's a very complex topic.

&gt; But I just want to be able to make a 100 pound profit for something I wanted to buy.

I don't see what this has to do with bitcoin.  Can you buy the thing you want with bitcoin, or only with pounds?  If not with bitcoin, then investigating bitcoin probably won't do anything to help you get that thing.

&gt; I’m not a gambler really so this will be a one off.

Ahhhh... so you're wanting to exchange some pounds for some bitcoin, wait until the relative exchange rate changes in your favour, then sell those bitcoin for pounds, is that right?

If so, then let me tell you straight away: There is absolutely *no one* that can tell you what the relative exchange rate of bitcoin to any particular fiat currency is going to do in the short term.  This method of trying to acquire more pounds is *purely* gambling.

&gt; I’ve heard that coinbase is a trustworthy site/app to buy and sell bitcoins.

I've heard the same, but never used them so can't advise you on that.

&gt; But after I receive my bitcoins how do I exchange them into pounds?

The same way you exchanged pounds for bitcoin.  Most of the large exchanges (I assume Coinbase too) let you ""cash out"" your fiat currency holdings through a transfer to your bank account.

&gt; How do I send and receive?

If your only intention is to gamble as above, then you don't ever need to send and receive.  You'd transfer pounds to the exchange, exchange those for bitcoin, leave the bitcoin on the exchange until you're ready, exchange the bitcoin for pounds, and then do a bank transfer to get the pounds out.

There are probably fees involved along the way for some of those steps (notably things like the ""getting pounds out and in to your bank), so you'd want to make sure that you know what those are in advance.

&gt; And most importantly, how can I tell if I’ve made profit before I exchange them into pounds? Because from what I’ve seen a single bitcoin is like 4K pounds, they’re all in decimals now which is a bit confusing.

If 1 bitcoin is 5000 pounds, you can get 0.1 bitcoin for 500 pounds.  Assuming you do this, then later if 1 bitcoin is worth 6000 pounds, you can get 600 pounds for your 0.1 bitcoin.  There you have your 100 pound profit (again, pay attention to any fees, since you might end up with a bit less after paying to get the pounds out again).

There are of course no guarantees that bitcoin will soon trade at 6000 pounds though.  It might happen tomorrow, or it might not happen for many many months/years (or technically, it might never happen, but I think that's extremely unlikely).  If the exchange rate were to continue the slide it's been on for the last few months, your value as measured in pounds of that 0.1 bitcoin would also continue decreasing.  If you were to exchange back to pounds at any point during that for whatever reason, you'd therefore have less pounds than you started with.

&gt; What is a trustworthy exchange/conversion site?

I mostly use bitcoin.de because it's quick and easy (tied directly to my bank account, so I don't need to transfer euro in to purchase), but I don't think you can use it outside of Germany.  I've also used Kraken and Bitflyer, both of whom I didn't have any real problems with (but others have reported some negative things, especially about Kraken's processes when dealing with customer questions/complaints)."	1522448143.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.464101	dwj3wde	t3_88abs6	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88abs6/any_kind_people_to_help_me_out/dwj3wde/	5	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	5

Furthermore, and more importantly, Bitcoin is not a revenue generating business or income yielding debt instrument, so valuation and investment models should reflect that. 

Silver was a hyped commodity in the 1970's and it's limited market size and demand caused a price spike whose levels weren't seen again for 40 years.

That is just something some bankers came up with to confuse and divert the masses. The tech as you know, since you’ve been here since 2011 is all referenced in the white paper. Just like chemistry you take certain compounds and mix them up and get the finished product. Without one of those compounds you come up with something quite different. Please recognize that. Everything has its right time and place. Everything. So you maybe a cryptographer but that doesn’t qualify you to be all knowing of the complexities of Bitcoin. I’ve come to admit to myself that I don’t know either. Traders don’t know. But we can build on what we have discovered that works. And currently that’s Bitcoin. By diluting the limited resources like yourself to other projects if you contribute dilutes the effect of creating the internet of money. 	1522411406.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.476103	dwijfuz	t1_dwihwcm	/r/Bitcoin/comments/886ce7/btc_lost_its_best_case_argument_of_hodl/dwijfuz/	0	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	0

However, I would also consider that the measurement shown just happens to start at the peak of the ATH at 17th of December 2017, at which point it is commonly believed that bitcoin, as well as many altcoins, were inflated and overvalued, just before the market crash and correction towards the lowest low of 5.8k at 6th of February.

Since the lowest low after the ATH dropped to 5.8k, compared with $6874 presently (as of writing), I'd be more inclined to look for a chart that show raw BTC-USD prices. Swings of dollar purchase power over the course of a few months doesn't really have much to do with bitcoin, or any other cryptocurrency.

Is bitcoin selling that data to some shady company who will then bombard me with fake news and trolls, trying to sway my political opinions one way or another?

6672	florianleber	Thats the problem. You cant value bitcoin like a company. Its inherent value is 0. However, it can still have value if it is largely used and adopted. We now had the third bubble with a lot of public interest but thete is still little to no adoption. Even worse, adoption is shrinking (just look at reddit or steam who have dropped btc). Without adoption, it is just a super risky speculative frenzy. I fear we need to conclude that btc has failed because it never managed to get the adoption it needed. The idea was brillant though.	1522408233.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.584110	dwigryg	t3_887bk8	/r/Bitcoin/comments/887bk8/where_is_the_value_of_bitcoin_calculated/dwigryg/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1
6673	Ttatt1984	"Failed? Tell that to people in Venezuela. Or in Africa... or anywhere that a corrupt government decides to overnight cancel the value of citizen’s bank accounts because it just felt like it. 

How is it that it failed? I sent 1btc last week to a friend in Europe. Confirmed transaction in a few hours. I used SegWit. transaction only cost me a few cents. Failed? Sure, I could have used western union... and would have to pay their fee. And although it feels instantaneous, the truth is that the bank and the clearing houses would still be processing that transfer. Or either my bank or my friends bank could have shut down, or been hacked, or have been compromised in some manner, and that transaction could be reversed. Banks aren’t fool proof. There are multiple layers where human error can create a nightmare scenario for me to have to clear up. 

Now you might also say that it was stupid of me to send 1 BTC last week since my friend now has that same 1 BTC but with less value in euros due to the price drop. But that’s not the point of BTC. 
1 BTC will always be 1 BTC. The market and the traders can still measure the value of their bitcoin in dollars, euros, yen, etc..... but since we believe in a world outside of that fiat system, our 1 BTC transaction is still worth 1 BTC. It hasn’t failed. It works as it’s designed to work. 

Adoption is still low... too low and thus premature to call it a failure. Imagine if Netflix had come out in the era of dial-up internet. Would the limitations of the internet infrastructure and the fact that not many people had internet connected computers in their home been sufficient reason to say that video streaming would be a failure of an idea that would never takeoff?

Bitcoin adoption WILL grow. Especially since we are seeing the early signs of how untrustworthy and volatile government fiat really is. When every government in the world owes everyone, and the only way they can pay that debt is by printing more money, the hyper inflation we are about to see will cause everyone to want to leave that system. Look at Greece, Argentina, Zimbabwe, and Venezuela. Their problems are not isolated incidents. Mismanagement at every central bank is happening and it’s only a matter of time before it collapses. 

Bitcoin adoption requires us to ask ourselves a simple question:

Do we trust the rules of an impartial math to protect a system of value? Or should we trust human institutions where there are multiple layers of vulnerabilities ranging from corruption to mismanagement and human error at every point where a middle man must be trusted?

6674	florianleber	Well written and i agree the idea is great. But i am not sure anymore if we will see adoption because the trend is going in the opposite direction and adoption is shrinking.

6675	Ttatt1984	"If adoption is shrinking, then we shouldn’t be seeing all these improvements being made to the network. Developers should be quitting in droves. Exchanges shouldn’t be opening. Hedge funds shouldn’t be hiring blockchain and crypto engineers. 

We see a downturn in a price over a period of 3 months and therefore conclude it’s a failure? Zoom the chart out. Where were we a year ago this week? Or two years ago? Or 5 years ago. 

Don’t confuse price trend with adoption. We still live and do commerce in a fiat world. That’s the reality of every business today... even amazon. It doesn’t make sense for amazon to lead when they have many financial obligations that need to be met with fiat. Microsoft takes bitcoin because they can afford to support the slow confirmation times that the network was experiencing a few months ago. But now with increased SegWit use and now Lightning Network a reality, businesses will be taking a second look. 

Just because something didn’t happen in the past three months or a year doesn’t mean it WONT happen. The infrastructure is still young. That’s like saying automobiles will never catch on because there aren’t any paved roads yet and these dirt paths meant for horse carriages are just too rough for automobiles. Plus, there weren’t  even gas stations at every corner and there wasn’t any regulation or DMV so how are pedestrians going to feel safe with these machines on wheels that shouldn’t even be on dirt paths?  But that didn’t prevent the technology from taking off eventually. 

With something as truly revolutionary as bitcoin, think of what’s possible when humans and middlemen are taken out of the equation.  It happened to blockbuster, it happened to Barnes and noble, it’s happening right now to retailers such as Macy’s and Sears, it happened to telephone switch operators, it happened to door to door salesmen, it happened to print journalism... and it’s going to happen to the banking system.  Where ever there is a human being trusted to make a decision or judgement call, that human is a point of failure that can be exploited.

 It’s much easier to find a person’s weak spot and use it to your advantage than it is to find a weak spot in the bitcoin blockchain. "	1522419280.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.584110	dwiom3z	t1_dwinm7m	/r/Bitcoin/comments/887bk8/where_is_the_value_of_bitcoin_calculated/dwiom3z/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

The code is all still ""Open"" in that you can read the entire code (And build it yourself, if you want to risk a lawsuit)

George Kimionis the Founder and CEO of Coinomi stated:

&gt;We do what we have to do to protect our users and our brand. Coinomi is a free wallet and its source code is open for everyone to review, but if you're asking us to allow just about anyone to create malicious clones of our wallet and steal users' funds and give up all rights to go after these scammers and their works then no, it's not going to happen. On top of that, I would strongly recommend you to be very careful when making unsubstantiated accusations in public such as that Coinomi Wallet ""is no longer free"" and that it was governed by a ""fishy"" license, as these could imply direct defamation of our firm.

In short, the code is open for review, but not technically ""Open source"" because you can't copy/use it without legal implications. (Nothing is physically stopping you, though.)

The only difference between this and open source is that open source lets you do whatever you want, and their license says ""Look at the code all you want, but you have NO permission to fork it, create a new wallet using this code, modifying it, or passing it as your own.

Nobody is forcing you to use the wallet, but nobody is forcing you to use your phone either. How do you know your iPhone or Android phone isn't going to send a log of all your typing back to the manufacture? Well, it's not open source, but people can and do decompile, root, jailbreak, packet sniff, etc. And while there is a lot to gain, they'd never come out ahead 

Coinomi makes a LOT of money on using ShapeShift and other exchanges. They take a small fee, but it adds up quickly. They make so much money, it isn't worth it to risk that. The main reason it's no longer open source is because the code for Changely and Shapeshift isn't open source, and it's impossible to integrate them without being closed source. 

Closed source free products can be risky, because ""nothing is free"". Mainly, you have to think, what are they gaining?

Wikipedia gets donations, lots of it. 
Microsoft visual studio gets marketing, and a bigger market share, and more people using their OS (because people who use VS typically are designing programs to work for widows, even if it can run and compile for Mac OS and Debian) Coinomi gets a metric shit ton of fees for the exchange, and Google has Android for free because they make lots of money off of the subscriptions and the play store.

You really don't. Perhaps should consider there's a subtlety here that's being lost on you.

&gt; How do you know your iPhone or Android phone isn't going to send a log of all your typing back to the manufacture? Well, it's not open source

This is weird becuase you actually acknowledge later in your post that Android source is available. Even so, I use a community version and not the one from Google or my manufacturer. 

&gt; the code for Changely and Shapeshift isn't open source, and it's impossible to integrate them without being closed source.

6710	pilotavery	"Android operating system is open source, but most manufacturers actually have some closed-source software and changes to Android that you're not able to see.

If you're using a community version of Android, then you are probably using open-source software. If you're using the Google apps no, then those apps are not open source. You probably flashed the OpenGAPPs zip in recovery, and not all of that is open source.

The Google Play Store, if you have it, is definitely not open source. The operating system is, but not the entire image that is running on your phone.

And while it is true, it's possible to release open source software without free libraries, changelly (maybe Shapeshift, I'm not sure) does not allow you to integrate their exchange into your app and still keep it open source. 

True, Wikipedia is open source, but my intentions were to counter the ""common knowledge"" that ""nothing is free"". While I agree that nothing is free, I don't believe that it has to charge money in order to make a profit.

6752	forgoodnessshakes	"tl;dr Futures markets are equivalent to creating bitcoins (over the 21MM limit) and selling them.

I think he's right about futures but they don't suppress price in the way he describes. Ensuring supply constantly runs ahead of demand, by manipulating every mainstream media channel is a bit far-fetched.

I think futures contracts suppress price because every futures contract mints new 'bitcoins' out of fiat (because they are settled in fiat). A contract for a bitcoin == a bitcoin.

This reduces scarcity and therefore reduces value. So, futures contracts trade below spot price in anticipation of reduced scarcity. This puts a downward pressure on price.

In fact, the more futures contracts that are issued, the more bitcoin moves down to meet the contracts' price. After all, who is going to buy a bitcoin if they can buy a 'future' bitcoin for much less?

Futures become a self-fulfilling prophecy; and the downward rachet ensures it only works one way, down. If futures had to be settled in the commodity they were speculating on this wouldn't work, as they would have to buy the underlying asset (like ETFs).

Everybody sees that bitcoin's on sale next week, so nobody pays more than $7900. Spot price moves down to Futures' price.

She says she's 'bought you a bitcoin for your birthday'. (She hasn't, she's bought you a futures contract but as far as she's concerned it's a legal deal and the same thing).

You might fall out and she might instead sell the contract to a friend who wants 'a bitcoin'.

On your birthday you buy a bitcoin or keep the cash, I don't care. Everybody takes the money. Even if they buy a bitcoin I'm back at the same game next month.

The more contracts I sell, the less upside risk there is, the more the market moves to meet me, the more commission I make.

A fully-paid up contract to buy a bitcoin at a future date is as good as a bitcoin. The only difference is that it isn't counted in the 21MM cap.

Cash settlement means that futures traders don't have to buy the asset that underlies their contracts, so the contract price can differ from the spot price.

6757	DesignerAccount	"&gt;Somewhat rude.

Not rude, but firm. It's the only way to address misguided nonsense.

OK, I'll go into a detailed debunk of your claims, that's to help any noobs who might be confused by your marketbabble. Let's start...

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;A fully-paid up contract to buy a bitcoin at a future date is as good as a bitcoin. The only difference is that it isn't counted in the 21MM cap.


There is no such a thing as a ""full-paid up contract to buy Bitcoin"". At least that's **not** what a futures is. A futures is only an *agreement to buy/sell in the futures, and SETTLE IN THE FUTURE*. You don't settle anything today. A futures is basically a shake of hands that you'll buy/sell in the future. Period. The exchange, on the other hand, requires *some* money down from both so it can settle the contract daily. But that's how the exchange protects *itself*, not you or your counterparty.

Also, a futures is not the same as a Bitcoin because I can close my position at any time, and the futures is no more. Bitcoin, on the other hand, cannot be ""created and destroyed"" at whim.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Cash settlement means that futures traders don't have to buy the asset that underlies their contracts, 

Yes and no. But mostly no. Even with physical settlement there is no need to buy the asset! You open a position, market rallies, you close the position and get cash. You've never seen or dremt about actually taking physical deliver of the underlying.

&gt;so the contract price can differ from the spot price.

Futures and spot price are **tightly constrained** by NO ARBITRAGE arguments, and that's regardless of physical or cash settlement. If one goes up, the other will follow. And the same is true in reverse.

&gt;ETFs have to constantly match their contracts with actual holdings, they aren't allowed to sell 'empty' contracts.


And yet, there's many more open futures contracts than there are commodities with physical delivery. 

Physical vs cash settlement has got nothing to do with price. Zero. Niet. Nada. Zilch.


&amp;nbsp;

&gt;&gt;Selling futures exposes you to the risk bulls will run all over you, and you'll lose your shirt.

&gt;Correct, however if you start slowly and build up volume, then bulls never get a chance because of the poison you're dripping all over them. Ask any gold or silver bug.


You just demonstrated that you have exactly zero real experience in the markets. Or, as Taleb would call it, no ""Skin in the Game"". Which is why this is all marketbabble.

Do you understand that you need cold hard cash for every position you open? And current margin requirements are ~30%, if not more, on CME and CBOE. That means for every Bitcoin futures, you need to put down 30% of the total contract value! So you can slowly build as much volume as you will, you'll need to put up that cash. 

And ""building volume"" simply means that you are ""selling at the prevailing price"". In other words, you've done your trade, and that's it... you're at the mercy of the market. If the market goes against you, which it easily can without you being able to do anything - remember, you've got only so much margin available to open positions - you get to experience what REKT **really** means.

Alternatively, you can short a bit now, market against you, short some more, market against some more, short some more, .... wash rinse and repeat. But that is again limited by the amount of cash you've got available as margin. And even if you have LOADS of money, you are not playing like a whale anymore, dripping a short here and there. Again, at the mercy of the market.

Finally, even if you put up tons of money, the exchange may simply refuse to let you open as many positions as you wish. Exchanges keep an eye on their customers, and if they see you're doing stupid shit, they'll refuse to open you all that many contracts. You cannot just deposit money in a brokerage account and, say, open 1000 contracts on oil. You just cannot. The people who can do that have been around the corner for ages, and are most definitely not wet behind their ears, unlike a noob. Why would the exchange behave like that? Because you could lose your shirt, and then your conspiratorial noob head would convince itself that it was the exchange's fault and you didn't understand all the risks, blah, blah, blah... and sue them. So they prevent it.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The risk is asymmetric. 

Try telling that to a hiring manager on Wall St and see if you get the job. Also demonstrates you don't understand the risks of futures trading... can you see why the exchange will just not let you open all that many positions?

&gt;If bitcoin is $8000 in the market, will I sell more contracts at $7000, or $9000?

You can sell neither for $7,000 nor for $9,000. Or better, if you attempt to sell at $9,000 you'll get no buyers. At $7,000 people will buy from you as much as they can, and sell their mothers to raise more money to buy from you. Why? Because for every contract you sell at $7,000 they will sell a Bitcoin at $8,000 and get a net, instant and risk-less profit of $1,000. And you'll be on the hook to deliver against your contracts, which will rip your head off. So the exchange won't let you sell any of them.

What I described above is an example of arbitrage trade which constrains the forward and spot price significantly. In the real markets, spot and futures will trade very tightly. Always! And regardless of physical vs cash settlement.

Arbitrageurs keep the spot and the futures price tight.

&gt;Would you rather wait for a store to have yet another sale, or volunteer to pay over the store price now in case they put their prices up massively in future?

Huh??? That's exactly why a market exists... some people think there's more to gain by waiting, others think there's more to gain by buying now. It's always been like that, in all the markets, and it again has nothing to do with physical vs cash settlement.


&amp;nbsp;

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7df33e/spot_vs_futures_arbitrage_and_all_that_a_mini/), I wrote this a while ago to clear some confused minds about spot vs futures price. Read it. And then read it again until it sinks in. You'll learn how simple arbitrage trades work as well.


&amp;nbsp;

It's not enough to be intelligent to speak intelligently about a topic. It's clear that you have no skin in the game. Take the time to educate yourself, by talking to people who have. And perhaps start playing in the markets, no better education than real life education.

A futures is only an *agreement to buy/sell in the futures, and SETTLE IN THE FUTURE*. You don't settle anything today. A futures is basically a shake of hands that you'll buy/sell in the future.

My point was that a valid futures contract (the right to buy a bitcoin) is tantamount to a bitcoin. When it is settled is irrelevant to that point. By 'fully-paid-up' I meant fully valid, not 'paid in advance', my bad.

The fact you have spent so much time refuting points I never made or that are irrelevant to the thrust of why futures are exerting a downward pressure on the market is appreciated, but I regret not helpful.

&gt;Also, a futures is not the same as a Bitcoin because I can close my position at any time, and the futures is no more. Bitcoin, on the other hand, cannot be ""created and destroyed"" at whim.

I agree. The fact you can't see that this is integral to my argument is disappointing. I never said that bitcoins can be created and destroyed on a whim.

A bitcoin futures contract effectively brings a bitcoin into existence. One side counts on owning one, the other side is under an obligation to facilitate the ownership.

Futures contracts constantly create and liquidate 'paper bitcoins'. The fact that contracts can be liquidated whereas bitcoins theoretically cannot, and your refutations of other points I never made, do not really add anything.

It is clueless marketbabble. And taking a presumed high moral ground won't help. Learn instead, will give you more insight.

&gt;why futures are exerting a downward pressure on the market is appreciated

This is false, futures don't exert any downward pressure, no matter how much you want it. And neither to they exert upward pressure. Again, you are not gonna get a job on Wall St if you keep making this kind of claims.

&gt;A bitcoin futures contract effectively brings a bitcoin into existence.

No it does not. A gold futures does not bring gold into existence. A cattle futures does not bring cattle into existence. A pork belly futures does not bring pork belly into existence.

&gt;One side counts on owning one, the other side is under an obligation to facilitate the ownership.

See? This is the simpleton's view, someone who has no idea what's going on. What if I buy a futures simply to speculate on the price? Do I still count on owning one?? And even those who actually want the Bitcoin, they will just get one of the existing ones, not a new one. Nothing is brought into existence.

&gt;Futures contracts constantly create and liquidate 'paper bitcoins'. The fact that contracts can be liquidated whereas bitcoins theoretically cannot, and your refutations of other points I never made, do not really add anything.

Nonsense rants. Sorry, you'll need to get a better understanding of spot and forward markets. Markets in general, that is.


&gt;Btw I've got plenty of skin in the game.

No you don't. It's pretty clear that you don't. Maybe a 20-something girl would buy that, but no one with REAL skin in the game would. I hope you are getting laid thanks to your ""Crypto trading prowess"". But you sure aren't making money off your ""trading"".

&gt; A fully-paid up contract to buy a bitcoin at a future date is as good as a bitcoin. The only difference is that it isn't counted in the 21MM cap.


even i know that this is bullshit. OP, you're dumb. if not, then you're a retarded fud-spreading dude without a clue.


let me explain you quick ELI5

the CME Futures are a contract, like a bet on the bitcoin price. either up or down. whoever wins the bet, will pay the other side what he lost IN FIATQ


&gt; 8. Do I need a digital wallet to trade Bitcoin futures?
&gt; No. You do not need a digital wallet, because Bitcoin futures are financially-settled and therefore do not involve the &gt; exchange of bitcoin.

there is no fucking bitcoin involved in future trading. especially does 1 Future Contrad **NOT** equals a bitcoin. are you nutz?"	1522367492.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.595602	dwha54i	t1_dwgxmt8	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87xjbg/bitcoin_manipulation_cartel/dwha54i/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1
6762	1BitcoinOrBust	If there are no sellers at $7900 (they'd rather hodl), then the spot price will struggle to reach that level. People will still pay a premium if they want bitcoin now (for example to actually use it to transfer funds). Also, at some point, observing the lack of sellers, futures contract writers will want to stock up on bitcoins that contract buyers will ask for. This will put further upwards pressure on the spot price, as well as on any new contracts you are willing to write.	1522339202.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.595602	dwgq1o4	t1_dwgoraf	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87xjbg/bitcoin_manipulation_cartel/dwgq1o4/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1
6763	forgoodnessshakes	"A few people will pay more this week, rather than wait and pay less next week, but these would be 'distress' purchases. There are always people who have to sell low or buy high.

Futures are settled in cash so no bitcoins need to be 'stocked up'. I would react to any upside risk by selling more contracts into the market so that everyone who wants a bitcoin at my price can get one.

Who would be dumb enough to pay more than the low price I was guaranteeing?"	1522353469.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.595602	dwgwshh	t1_dwgq1o4	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87xjbg/bitcoin_manipulation_cartel/dwgwshh/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

6770	talks_about_stuff	The derivatives market is the biggest man made bullshit ever. It caused the mortgage meltdown and historically fucked up the rare metals market - ie. gold, silver, you name it. It only benefits those who run these financial casinos while the average Joes just gamble away their hard earned money hoping to come out on top. It doesn’t take much for them to make you think you’ve got a losing hand, and you fold right when they want you to, or contrarily they can lure you in to doubling down at the worst times. Our best chances are to keep our emotions and play by the book like you would blackjack, buy the dips and take some profit after rallies. The House always wins, but you can improve your chances by learning the rules of the game. Don’t get caught up in the FUD or FOMO mentalities, don’t get caught up in the HODL mentality. I know it’s difficult but never shut yourself off from opposing views, always check what the other side is saying. Also Spend some of your earnings, reinvest in yourself and people you care about!

6874	zomgitsduke	"Millennials understand the idea of the ""copycat approach"" for other crypto trying to be ""like Bitcoin but better"" and they don't trust it. Yes, many cryptos do different things, but as of right now money is the major item of concern. Millennials are struggling to earn money and maintain the value associated with it. They understand inflation, how money is abused by governments, how countries collapse because their government isn't responsible, and how scarcity plays a vital role in value(collector's edition, video games with rarity established, trading card games, mathematics between supply and demand, etc.)

It also doesn't have a founding organization that can turn on them (much like many companies that start out offering a ""free"" service and have ulterior motive, or the ones that start as too good to be true, then turn on the monetization dynamic once the service becomes of value to society).

Bitcoin is just ""free"" in the terms that the rules won't change violently, no new CEO can come in and restructure, no one is there to extract a profit from them, and promises can't really be broken.

No surprise that millennials prefer Bitcoin. We have bullshit detectors that can detect a lie from a thousand miles away.

And I cannot think of a better demographic to adopt Bitcoin as a serious tool for exchanging value."	1522296182.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.627599	dwfqywl	t3_87tsnh	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87tsnh/millennials_prefer_to_invest_in_bitcoin_over_any/dwfqywl/	11	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	11

7013	Mycamena	Rubbish. Every regular gambler I’ve ever met is down over all. The problem is most of them just don’t honestly describe their losses. They kid themselves that some of the losses don’t count and they block them out of memory. They always remember the $500 win but forget to mention the thousands they lost b fore it. It’s self delusion. If you treat investing like gambling and expect an illogical win instead of holding, you’ll lose on that too. Investment takes patience and research. Over the long term those who’ll hold their shares (or crypto) outperform those who sell after holding for a short time. 	1522413300.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.648603	dwikwm3	t1_dwikaae	/r/Bitcoin/comments/887mc0/today_i_lost_90_of_my_bitcoin/dwikwm3/	7	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	7
7014	wake_iw	"I’ve always treated gambling like investing - aiming for low gains on a regular basis. 

If team A is 1/10 to beat team B then most people shy away from the bet - those same people would happily take a 10% gain from a bank (or crypto) and claim it was free money. 

Sticking with sports you know and understanding the dynamics of the particular game (is it a “nothing game”/dead rubber etc. likely to field an weak team or is it a “must win” ) is key of course - as it is in investing. 

Using betting exchanges takes a bit of practice but opening a bet at 1.2 and closing when it hits 1.1 locks in your profit (“all green”) if you want to restrict your risk. 

I always described my approach as being shorter term with higher risk than normal investing - then I got into crypto and all of a sudden the bet I made yesterday for this weekends fixtures seems a lifetime away!

7015	slugur	"Before you call me ""rubbish"", I am only claiming  to be up from sports betting. Spread can be beaten in the long run. It's the money management and lack of discipline that will turn a lot of winners into losers. I started in 2002ish when online sports betting was still in its infant stage. Lines were a lot easier to beat and line movement was ridiculous. College bball total would move 10-15 points off opening within seconds and if you knew what you were doing, you  won a lot. Books evolved and general public caught on, so those days are over, but you can still  profit in the long run in sports betting."	1522415023.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.648603	dwim43w	t1_dwikwm3	/r/Bitcoin/comments/887mc0/today_i_lost_90_of_my_bitcoin/dwim43w/	0	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	0

Currently, it really comes down to collateralization. You can collateralize to other currencies, which is the easiest option, but then it wouldn't be really be independent (even if it were still decentralized).

You could also collateralize with the future value of the coin through a price stabilizing protocol that offers seigniorage to the next coins when the price drops, raising demand and therefore price again because it offers an easy way to make money. This of course requires widespread adoption and steady use, otherwise people would not stand to gain money from the seigniorage.

Centralization doesn’t exist because the powers that be want to control you. Centralized banking exists because modern economies would collapse without it.

Look at what $20 USD can get you today, compared to 10 years earlier, and then 10 years earlier than that and so on. Our dollar has lost value because banks and government makes an infinite amount of money.

At the end of the day, bitcoin has a finite supply, no more will be mined after 21,000,000.

So if they entire worlds economy was invested into BTC, everybody would have their share of bitcoin whether it be 1, 5, or 100, or maybe only part of a bitcoin. But the value would hold steady because then bitcoin would only exchange hands. No one would be able to manipulate it by just printing more money

And yeah, I understand how inflation works. It gets magnified over large time scales. But are you keeping cash in your wallet for decades? Hopefully not. There are systems that allow you to safely store your money in accounts for short, long, or extremely long periods of time so that you don’t lose money to inflation.  The money you keep in short term form should be getting spent in the short term. 

Also, your argument for a stable bitcoin is fallacious and based on the idea that an economy never grows. Imagine the hypothetical economy of clockworks. Everyone buys and sells only clocks. One year, clock factories produce and sell 10,000 clocks and everyone has 10,000 dollars. So clocks and dollars can be exchanged giving the dollar value. But next year, 20,000 clocks are produced but there is still only 10,000 dollars. So each dollar can now buy double the number of clocks. At a constant supply, the value of a dollar has deflated. 

Now, a bunch of clever clockworkians realize “hey, the economy does this every year. Why would I buy 2 clocks this year when I can buy 4 clocks next year?” And so they do that. The decreased spending reduces revenue for clock factories who are subsequently unable to increase their production at the same rate. The economy is now worse off because of the deflationary nature of a static money supply.

If it was unequivocally good, cryptos with built-in scarcity wouldn't be as popular as they are today and would have never gained popularity either.

Sure, it is good for ""divisibility"" reasons and good for ""medium of exchange"" reasons, but inflation, especially of the kind of most fiat currencies today, is massively dismissive of the ""store of value"" aspect of money.

This isn't being pedantic, either, my point is that we can't just hand-wave away the ""sound money"" folks or the gold-bugs when there are now glaring examples of better ""store of value"" money that is not only popular but in some cases also superior to fiat in the present age.

We cannot keep acting like the Federal Reserve or the IMF are without their faults.

7045	Nick0013	"&gt;	If it was unequivocally good, cryptos with built-in scarcity wouldn’t be as popular as they are today and would have never gained popularity either.

Disagree. I think most people are generally ignorant about the benefits of inflation. It’s easy and intuitive to immediately take the view of “money loses value over time = bad thing”. Problem is that reality is often counterintuitive. So people would still jump on the bitcoin train chasing ill-conceived dreams of a “perfect currency” that wont behave how they think it will behave. These ”ignorant dreamers” will give the coin some popularity.

In addition, you have many people completely disintetested in it as a widely adopted currency. They are useful in illegal transactions (Arguably what sparked the current popularity). Also, many people are just investing in them in the hopes that the value continues to rise. Most people are trying to make money off of it, so they dont care about its use as currency. Combined, these groups can give the coin significant populatity despite its major flaw of being deflationary.

In a vacuum, inflation would disrupt a dollars ability to be a “store of value”. However, we aren’t all chucking dollars under our mattress every payday. You want money to spend today? Put it in your wallet, it will keep its value for a day. Use it in the next few months or years? Checking and savings will have interest rates that match inflation to maintain the value of your dollar. You can throw money into retirement accounts for some tax advantaged storage of value. 

The point is this, our system has recognized that inflation could create issues with money acting as a store of value. We have created systems to completely mitigate these effects. What has bitcoin done to mitigate its harmful and inevitable deflationary tendencies? What possibly *could* be done since it’s inherently unregulated?"	1522369523.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.659600	dwhchvo	t1_dwh98wk	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87y0yh/why_cant_bitcoin_retain_its_value/dwhchvo/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1
7046	LucSr	"Let’s design a sound money in a thought experiment.

The axiom of purchasing power is to pay the same amount of money to boil water in a remote past and future; recall the middle school physics that to heat 100g water from 25C to 100C requires the same amount of energy always.  In other words, being a sound money, 1.0 coin shall represent a constant amount of energy always.

Economy can not be advanced without more or efficient energy input and this is why a modern worker is richer than a landlord hundred years ago thanks to industry revolution.  Currently, the energy per capita of the world is around 70G Joules per year which is also a measure of current worldwide economy size.  Since 1.0 coin's value is constant, money volume shall increase/decrease to be compatible with better/worse economy condition.  

By Paris's agreement, people shall eventually use the constant energy influx from the Sun instead of harvest energy from the ""ancient energy container"" coal and petro.  Since only constant energy available yearly, the economy size can not change in the measure of energy, therefore the sound coin for the economy shall be constant volume and allows a speculation period for people to find the final correct price because no one is sure how big the economy could be.

The sound coin's value doesn’t need the approval of an authority because it is done by proof-of-work meaning ""a public understanding of energy amount to get 1.0 coin"" which is also the public understanding of the energy amount to fake 1.0 coin.  Seasonally, coin value may appreciate/depreciate value in summer/winter due to better Sun light in summer.  But years over years and with better battery technology, its value is stable.  At the same time, Tesla may set up subsidiary in different countries and maintain a centralized so-called Teslacoin whose 1.0 coin represents 1.0 kwh and people can fund their account by electricity generators to handle micro payment or scale issues locally.  When Joe migrates to another country, he exchanges the local Teslacoin to the global sound coin.  Both Teslacoin and the sound coin are sound by design, however Teslacoin is more centralized and less secured (Musk being bad someday?) and the sound coin is more secured and more valuable.  Currently, 1.0 bitcoin represents 2.186E+12 Joules by a guess in arbitrage-free pricing.

7047	Nick0013	"I’m not sure what exactly your point was at the end with Tesla coins and stuff. But I think I get the gist. You’re saying “In the long term, economies will stop growing because we will reach a limit energy production. Therefore, a constant money supply can function in the present day”. Your argument is predicated on three flawed assumptions

1) Economies only grow through increased energy production. (Automation, materials, innovation, computation, etc. are not necessarily correlated to increased energy production. Simplified: energy required go build a widget doesn’t remain constant)

2) We are anywhere close to the limit of solar energy harvest. (Far from it)

3) We do not pursue any means of energy production beyond ground based  solar harvesting (nuclear And  space based solar could be widely expanded before we reach the solar limit)

You’re talking about extremely long time scales that may never come. I don’t want to live with an economy in the toilet for centuries because it might eventually work if economies stop growing. So to answer your question 

&gt;	do we really need all the stuff Average Joe praises, the central bank, the inflation of money, the... to have a sound economy?

Yes. Until someone can point out how it will not cause short term and chronic catastrophe, I want an inflationary currency. "	1522387903.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.659600	dwhxe49	t1_dwhma36	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87y0yh/why_cant_bitcoin_retain_its_value/dwhxe49/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1
7048	LucSr	"&gt; I’m not sure what exactly your point was at the end with Tesla coins and stuff.

It is about scale debate in bitcoin.  But never mind, for the topic in this thread about inflation/deflation, we can bypass the weakness of centralization and assume Tesla set up the Teslacoin business which we use as money happily.

&gt; flawed assumptions:  Economies only grow through increased energy production. (Automation, materials, innovation, computation, etc. are not necessarily correlated to increased energy production. Simplified: energy required to build a widget doesn’t remain constant)

Clever AI automation robots require energy to function.  Additional energy is required to refine materials generally.  An innovative genius would do hunting task instead of innovation by command of his father if the energy for the food production is not enough.  Historically, all civilization growth is accompanied with increase of disposable energy either by more harvesting or higher efficiency about energy.  It is almost an operational definition of economy growth.

&gt; We are anywhere close to the limit of solar energy harvest. (Far from it). We do not pursue any means of energy production beyond ground based solar harvesting (nuclear and space based solar could be widely expanded before we reach the solar limit)

Yes.  It is possible to advance economy by what you say.  However, some source of energy may change the material compositions of the environment and possible harmful in a future (the nuclear waste or coal CO2 etc.).  So, the safest sources are the ones that never change the compositions of the environment.  But this is the Paris's topic which we can agree or disagree here in this thread.  We can go for no more energy growth (therefore no economy growth) but with constant money volume.  We can also go for energy growth but with correspondent proportional money volume.  We can also prey for energy like a plague in the universe for our economy growth if we have excellent spaceships.

&gt; You’re talking about extremely long time scales that may never come. I don’t want to live with an economy in the toilet for centuries because it might eventually work if economies stop growing.

Not extremely long term.  Based on many global news or events of the decades, personally I think the current life style is good enough and I prefer no more energy growth in which a constant volume money is for; the coming sustainable energy is to replace the traditional sources of energy, not for increasing the total energy.  This doesn't mean bad life style, it simply means I may prefer wash the dishes by hands rather than by the machine or jog in the trail rather than in the gym.

&gt; Until someone can point out how it will not cause short term and chronic catastrophe, I want an inflationary currency.

This is where I don't understand about your argument.  While the Teslacoin has no any shortcomings (people won't get rich by holding therefore being lazy for work, people won't lose purchase power, people won't need to know mysterious rates to calculate the real wealth, people won't be fooled to become poorer in real term) and its volume is changing naturally (no need the central bank to control the volume) until people are ok with the economy size, why you desire a depreciating money?

Anyway, bitcoin will not appreciate forever, as long as the correct pricing is reached and people want to survive rather than economy growth, it will be like the Teslacoin who never appreciate or depreciate.

7049	Yorn2	"You haven't refuted that cryptos with scarcity are, in fact, popular today. You could argue that their failure is imminent or even state that ten or twenty years from now they will fail, but that doesn't explain why they have a value today, which means that ""inflation isn't unequivocally good"" is still a legitimate point. If it was required for good money, then Bitcoin wouldn't have been possible to begin with. You made fine points, many I would agree with in your recent comment, but you haven't proven that non-inflationary money cannot work. Both Gold and Bitcoin stand as proof otherwise, regardless of waxing or waning popularity, they both remain in use as money. Inflation simply cannot be a unequivocal good.

While you can argue that adoption isn't ""widely adopted"" enough, that's a very hard point to make to someone like me, who made their first purchase of Bitcoin in 2011. To me, Bitcoin has succeeded, beyond my wildest dreams, in fact. While I thought I was getting into an experimental currency that may or may not have value, its success has changed my life and I use it, even as a currency, today.

That's what I mean about the ""hand-waving"" of advocates of sound money. In a unique experiment over the last nine years, we have an example of a currency that, for all intents and purposes, has succeeded despite fiat previously being seen as the only alternative. Fiat may well hold its reign as the primary alternative for quite some time, too, but gold and metal-based coins still have a 6,000 year record whereas globally-dominant fiat has been in use in Western history arguably since the 11th to 13th century in Italy, then Portugal, then Spain, then the Netherlands, then France, then England and finally the US and -- just now or perhaps very soon -- China.

So 6,000 years vs. ~800 years vs. 9 years. All three of them money. All three with their various attributes that make them good money, but all three of them in wide enough use that they are unlikely to go away at this point.

This argument applies to FOREX trading as well. It also applies to precious metals and other assets. 

You could have a cryptocurrency locked to another currency, e.g. USD, so you always 'have as much value as you invest in it', but that seems fairly pointless.

I don't think there's a good measure for what is or isn't slow progress, or if a disruptive like Bitcoin is the sort thing that you would expect to follow a linear growth pattern in terms of usage (I'd bet it isn't).

Also, maybe this is location specific, but you definitely have a 'buy' and 'sell' rate when converting currency, and the two prices are shown side-by-side (which is one way to see how much they're gouging you).

Not really, if anything new things have been introduced and others improved, yet Bitcoin's valuation is more than 50% less than the last ATH.  Do you think Bitcoin is worth 20 thousand dollars? Then only sell your Bitcoin at 20k, it will eventually be pushed to that price. 

The thing not everyone feels this way. Actually, and I believe this is no secret to anyone, no regulations mean that people can do whatever they want. Even buying and selling from themselves.  So I, a massive whale (hypothetically), sets up 2 accounts, one with a ton of btc and the other with a ton of cash. I start putting very low sell orders with my btc account, and start aggressively buying them with my cash account. Since I'm a whale I'm capable of overloading the exchanges volume, pretty much mantain most of the operations between this 2 accounts, effectively dropping the price. However, the same is done when the intention is to pump it. 

This is price manipulation and it's Bitcoin's worst enemy. Not because what it does to it in the exchanges, but what it does to our minds. We start forgetting Bitcoin is not about it's Fiat value, it's about replacing Fiat. :)

Please read a bit about how Bitcoin works, the whole idea of the blockchain is the fact that this is NO longer needed as we are interacting with a trustless entity. You will never have a situation where you're transaction ""is stuck"" or ""stolen"" unless you deliberately messed something up (that includes hacking, you get hacked because you messed up). Even in that situation there are 3rd party services that can help provided you manage your funds with them. But that's the thing, it's about choice, you could trust a 3rd party or you could simply don't. It's up to you. You can't do that with Fiat.

In terms of loans, blockchain is even better and more efficient and , again, we interact with a trustless state machine that will only react to truth (the loan was given, the client payed first invoice, etc etc)

7098	saiditreadit	"""From my understanding this is how it should work... Bitcoin as Currency Example-i have $5000 in cash , i then purchase/convert my $5000 in cash into BTC. Then i use my btc to do everyday transactions. So lets say I buy a cheeseburger and for it in btc. The btc is deducted from my wallet and transferred to the vendor. Done its paid for. The value of bitcoin doesn't change, it only changes hands- the value still stays with-in the btc market.""

I could be wrong isn't there a transaction fee associated? If so it does not convert 100% and not to mention gets taxed too?
Also as I have mentioned in other posts bitcoin does not retain value because its similar to gambling AND is a very very bad version of stock market which also gets dominated by fear and speculation but atleast in stock market the financial health of the company will guarantee its bounce back unless ofcourse it looses trust of people case point Equifax and now FB, but we all know that train derails and has been doing so for bitcoin even more often.

Bitcoin is dominated by fear simply because there is no logic. Bitcoin is good only for day-traders I guess. Long run users are in for real heartbreaks.

You'd either need to have an immediate short term need to use the coin which doesn't seem to exist in any meaningful level yet, or be a fool as for the same value you can generate the coin plus more yourself at a better price.

The recent dip that's been happening could be the result of just that; people buy into the hype, then hope of striking it rich quick and once that's gone, they move on and never come back. This could be the beginning of the end for Bitcoin and probably all of cryptocurrency. 

Bitcoin has been around 2009 - almost ten years. Even today, it's hardly been utilized and only a handful are actively using cryptocurrencies for its purpose. The concept is good, but too complex for the majority to understand, which is why cryptocurrencies will likely never replace the flexibility and simplicity of fiat money. Why replace something that already works? Ten years is a very long time, yet it hasn't affected the popularity of fiat money in most parts of the world. This is a big indication that cryptocurrencies are not all that cracked up to be. 

Anyone can make a news article and claim that ""experts believe Bitcoins will reach an x amount of money by this time"" but in reality, nobody knows. I certainly don't think bitcoins will reach a tremendous amount of money anytime soon. 10 more years from now, I could see Bitcoins still being around 4 digits since there's a lot of them in circulation and I don't think it will gain in much popularity being that it's hardly easy to understand how it works.

Specially when there is a lack of understanding on a technological innovation. Why don't you assume that the price would be 50$, if the blockchain era is here to stay, a more stable universal token could be used instead of btc, so the market cap would be trillions but the price of today's known tokens just a few millions.

When you take profit from apple, that's profit sharing from the generated revenue of the company based on the % of shares you hold.

If we were making everyday purchases in BTC, the value would never leave the market. It only exchanges hands. So your initial investment will grow in value, but you will be spending bitcoin or satoshis instead of cashing out your BTC to USD.

&gt; Stop confusing people by calling it Bitcoin Wednesday when it's actually also about altcoins.

It's called Bitcoin Wednesday out of deference to the de facto standard, most-proven, most-tested and very first blockchain, and we cover it too.

It turns out that the large majority of Bitcoiners / majority of people prefer to be educated about the whole industry, not just a narrow part of it.  And maybe people in The Netherlands don't get confused that easily.

7237	Ttatt1984	"its a perfect storm of reasons.

one is that all those people who made money on the run up now have to pay taxes on those gains. since they expected the price to continue to rise, perhaps they expected their early 2018 bitcoin gains to help with the tax bill. but uh oh..... that didn't happen and instead they are now at a loss. and the longer they hodl, the more their losses are and yet they still need to pay the taxman. so expect further price pressure until april 17. 

the same goes for all of those people who made gains on alt-coins and now have to pay taxes on it. chances are they're offloading their crypto portfolios to raise cash.

however, another reason its been going down is due the fear of regulation that is coming towards ICO's. People buy ICO's and alt-coins primarily with BTC or ethereum. For example, you cant buy coins on Binance with a direct deposit of USD. you need to have bought BTC or ethereum or LTC first and then sent it over and use that to fund your alt-coin trades. but since regulators are clamping down on ICO's, that puts selling pressure on those coins. First you sell your alt-coin, then you quickly sell your BTC for cash after transferring it to an exchange that lets you convert crypto to cash. 

With the prospect of regulation, who in their right mind would buy ICO's or alt-coins? so there goes any reason to buy more BTC.

then we had the FUD about Korean exchanges in January, and then the ongoing drama of whether Tether is legit or not. 

Then came the Mt. GOX trustee selling his coins to raise cash to give back to people who lost when that mess happened a few years back. However, it turns out he has ALOT of coins left to sell and although it seems like he's done for now, he's still sitting on a large pile and any sale would likely depress the price further. 

Then Facebook, Google, and Twitter have announced theyre going to ban ads for ICO's and alt-coins. this isn't good for the price but it is good for bitcoin in the long run. People shouldn't be buying alt-coins because of an ad. Bitcoin never ran a single ad and look where it got. But people will be people and they can be easily scammed and it is responsible decision-making by these companies to stop these ads in the first place. 

Overall, the reasons for why bitcoin has gone down are mostly economical and political reasons. People aren't going to buy something that the government is going to say 'no no, not so fast. you gotta play by these rules first'.  

however, that which gives bitcoin its true value remain intact and stronger than before.  Lightning Network is now live. Cheaper, faster transactions are now a reality. The network itself is still going strong. There haven't been any successful attacks to its integrity and security. its working as it was designed to do.

going forward, expect more downside. the crypto rules are still being written by government regulators.  Companies are still navigating the process of how to implement bitcoin as a payment service at retail.  and we still have under a month until tax time in the US.  Fear and disappointment, lack of knowledge, and lack of patience will cause many to give up and stop hodling and will instead sell at a loss.   

and then the buyers will come back in. "	1522370303.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.744600	dwhdesa	t3_881e9y	/r/Bitcoin/comments/881e9y/can_anyone_please_explain_why_bitcoin_and_other/dwhdesa/	4	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	4

7245	Ttatt1984	"you can buy two potatoes for a dollar today. over time, that same dollar wont be able to buy half of one potato. the people that hoard dollars today are only going to end up buying less potatoes in the future than they could have if they bought today. Why? because of the magic of inflation.  Now don't get me wrong. i understand the positives of inflation and how it stimulates spending today which itself stimulates the economy. that purchasing power of that dollar erodes and its the fear of that erosion that compels people to spend today.

However, a monetary system that compels spending via inflation is a system that creates bubbles and financial crisis. Furthermore, that monetary system is itself devaluing its own currency, increasing the likelihood of its total collapse if tomorrow we wake up to one morning where everyone's debt becomes unsustainable and some big country wants its money back and starts dumping treasuries. 

If china and Russia and a few EU member states start dumping US treasuries and begin to trade commodities with each other using their own currencies, the dollar is no more. in that very likely scenario (due to the United States' massive debt) one will need wagons full of dollars to get those two potatoes.

When the next recession comes along we'll have the same problem as in every financial crisis: ""Access to capital will become a problem."". But since it's a finite resource bitcoin is in fact capital.

Money just like bitcoin has no inherent value whatsoever. Think of it as a system of motivational votes that helps everyone get work done so that they can trade their goods or services for other goods or services. That's what money accomplishes. If access to money becomes a problem then bitcoin will flourish.

Unless a big whale start buying and push prices higer or stop the decline, prices will keep going down to close to zero. As I said before, crypto should have never been allowed to be traded with money. Coinbase should be banned and liqudated and money given to investors who lost money. Can you see the writing on the wall?

As transactions are verified, you can include any still valid transactions from the mempool.  You can then grind a nonce range, and then as more transactions come in, you can swap them out.  This is common since you want to include the transactions with the most fees per byte.

In December when the price was going higher and higher the network couldn't handle all the action and so fees were sky high and network delays were long.  Now things have slowed down which I feel is great = giving the network the time it needs to build and evolve so the next bull run won't be more than the network can handle and off we go.

The roller coaster is real and at multiple times I've been like ""Oh man these coins are worthless, it's over"" and I've always been proved wrong. When the dips come I usually just take a step back and stop checking anything bitcoin related for a while.

For me, the only thing that worries me now is the opening of the futures market. It might have been inevitable, and this price correction certainly is, but it's got the confident part in me a bit shaken.

Up until that point, it was in everyone's best interest for the price to rise. Dips were great, but there was no real incentive to drive the price down.

Now there are competiting forces, and the big players with decades of experience, the knowledge of how to absolutely rape unregulated markets, and huge amounts of money to throw around are involved.

Bitcoin and decentralized tech always represented a real threat to a lot of current hierarchical structures, but aside from trying to ban it or regulate against it, the cat was out of the bag and there was no way to stop the ""idea.""

This was a much sneakier move, and it allows all the big boys who have a vested interested in maintaing some kind of psuedo-control of the financial/stock markets to manipulate and control this as well.

If so, it makes holding a lot easier.  TA is junk science and you never know how the price will move each day.  You can't predict large whales buying or selling or how other traders will react to their activity.  But, if you can accurately assess the true value of something, you can sleep well knowing the price will eventually catch up.  It may take years, but it will happen.

7339	RayWeil	More specifically when the 50-day moving average moves below the 200-day moving average then the only possible rationale is that you are in a bear market.  Meaning, in the CURRENT market there are more coins up for sale than there is appetite to buy which is driving the price down.  Once supply and demand meet then maybe buyers will return.  The issue is as the price falls those holding may wish to add to the glut of supply to pare their losses down.  Then it gets painful.	1522351519.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.754599	dwgvmdk	t1_dwgiscp	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87y4r8/how_do_you_stay_optimistic/dwgvmdk/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

The estimate from Tom Lee is that alts will continue to move sideways until roughly August - at which point we will most likely see a similar ""alt craze"" to the run-up a couple months ago. 

That being said, there are almost 1600 alts listed on coinmarketcap and it just keeps going up... There is no way 90% of these projects are viable which means most likely the real winners are in the top ~150. And even then all the vaporware out there will eventually disappear - and there are quite a few coins in the top 150 that are vaporware garbage.

7445	EuropaWeGo	"There’s an altcoin called TimeNewBank(TNB) that has partnered with a company for international use and is currently being used right now. 

 You are right however, that most investors invest into altcoin due to speculation with a short term goal. 

My main issue with most altcoins. Is that there’s so many useless ones among them. There are a so few that are currently being used within any application. That it’s dirtying the waters for the few that are truly useful.

Soo, you might not have any use for it... But fuck, it has sure been useful for me since I started using Bitcoin back in 2011.

Edit: I just try to Buy something of value and eventually when the price rises, sell it for something needed. Like paying off debt, or buying a backup engine for my vehicle.

Wall street doesn’t give a flying f$&amp;k about Bitcoin. They will sell non pegged ETF to Dolores...period
Because they cannot control it or seize massive positions. It’s not diluted enough. ETFs will replicate that with the possibility of “owning” the honey pot. 

Real investors, like T.Draper,  want to invest in projects with industry ties and solving actual solutions. 
New hedge funds like BlockTower (the excellent Ari Paul) are a prime example of the new ecosystem being out in place and waiting for a clear road to pour billions.

-&gt; As soon as regulation on cryptos are up, and some custodian solutions emerge, big money will flow into alts.

But... only a HANDFUL of alts...

Bitcoin remains great. But it’s overpowered glorious days of 80% dominance are over imho. And it’s probably a good thing for Bitcoin too.

7541	EuroTrashCarDoc	"I'd make the argument that in this age of ""diversity"" it's actually much easier for a female to get hired than a man with the exact same qualifications. 

Also, I don't think I'd agree that simply being a female in tech is an accomplishment any more than it is for a male. The accomplishment is getting the degree, not picking it in the first place. Females simply do no choose tech as a major as often as males do. There are exactly zero barriers to entry based on gender, no one is saying ""LOL you can't do that, you're a girl.""

Equal education does not always equate to equal treatment.  	1522392295.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.909099	dwi1uim	t1_dwi1qk7	/r/Bitcoin/comments/8859vu/strong_women_in_crypto/dwi1uim/	2	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	2
7543	EuroTrashCarDoc	"Why the shifting goalposts? First it was that there are less women in tech. When I pointed out there is absolutely nothing stopping women from pursuing these degrees but the fact is that they just don't choose the major as often, then it became ""well it's harder to get hired."" When I pointed out that women are much more likely to get hired than an otherwise equally skilled man suddenly it became about treatment. 

I'm not trying to say that men aren't often being sexist idiots. I don't think anyone would deny that. But to get past that stupidity we need to talk about gender LESS, not more. The more you make it a big deal, the bigger deal it becomes. It's a self fulfilling prophecy.

This right here says a lot about why you might be finding yourself in these shitty situations. As much as you might not like what that poster had to say, they were right. In a world that's truly equal that's exactly how things work. 

What you're talking about now is just life. Dealing with shitty personal biases and egos is just a part of having to deal with the human race. Perhaps it's not your gender but your attitude that was hurting you. A boss choosing someone else for a promotion is not necessarily the fault of your vagina. It's really seeming like you just want to play the victim, and I bet that attitude carries over into real life. Maybe that's the reason you didn't get promoted. Doesn't play well with others.

People work for non-profit because they like what the org does. For example EFF is a good org.

There's no privacy options for the fiat side of the transfer. So AFAICT, your trade is never private and you might as well used a centralized exchange.

In both cases, there's a third party who knows who the first two parties are. For example, using Square cash: Square knows who sent a fiat payment and who received it. I suppose there's a minor benefit of square not knowing what the payment was for. But the drawback of almost zero liquidity and much higher risk than an exchange, is way too much to stomach for this minor benefit."	1522298786.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.914098	dwftth5	t3_87rvo7	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87rvo7/just_started_using_the_decentralised_exchange_bisq/dwftth5/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

So they are not going to get many hodlers to sell. It will require some miners to sell to stay alive but that is less than 200k coins. Then you run into the lower it goes it makes it cheaper for hodlers to buy one. And it makes it cheaper for the average person to buy one too. And until 2020 there is only going to be 684K a year. 

Next we have the lightning network growing worldwide. Countries are becoming more friendly to accepting bitcoin as a payment. Even passing legislation. And then you have a few hundred thousands of ppl like me who buy $x amount each month no matter what. We are ideological. That’s how we save. So the lower it goes we get more bitcoin for less fiat. 

So at what point is this a bear market. Because a chart says so. I think not. The tech boom in the 90’s was companies. The internet never crashed. It only got bigger.

&gt; This video is pretty misleading.  It's a good illustration of how big a 256 bit number is, but NOT a good illustration of how secure 256 bit security is.  These cryptographic hash functions are broken and need to be replaced every few years.  This happens because weaknesses are found in the algorithm that make them easier to guess, and has very little to do with raw computing power.  SHA-1 is now considered dangerously weak, and output 160 bits.  No one made a computer that checked all 2^160 combinations.  People found weaknesses in the algorithm.

Solving, we get x= -2y and z=0, corresponding to the point (-2:1:0) in homogeneous coordinates. As the z-coordinate is 0, this point lies on the line at infinity.

It's r/Bitcoin, but still nobody gets the joke, unbelievable! What's wrong with these Bitcoiners nowadays, are they just coming for a Make-Money-Fast scheme!?

In projective geometry, parallel lines indeed do intersect at [point at infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_at_infinity). Does it have anything to do with Bitcoin? Bitcoin uses Elliptic Curve Cryptography, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography is built upon some fundamental concepts from projective geometry, including point at infinity.

Read [some basic tutorial](http://andrea.corbellini.name/2015/05/17/elliptic-curve-cryptography-a-gentle-introduction/) to grasp the basis here, all your Bitcoins in your wallet literally depend on the (non-euclidean geometry) assumption that two parallel lines do intersect at infinity to exist. [OpenSSL Wiki](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Elliptic_Curve_Cryptography#What_is_an_Elliptic_Curve.3F) also makes a good explanation.

Those who downvoted the parent comment are damned to have not-working Elliptic Curve Cryptography and lost all the Bitcoins in their wallet."	1522337808.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.927100	dwgpfg4	t1_dwep6om	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87myor/hal_finney_while_paralyzed_by_als_wrote_code_for/dwgpfg4/	0	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	0

7717	scs3jb	"The issues with being that confident are all the coincidences about the timeline around Hal and Satoshi, I can understand subscribing to the theory they are two different entities, but could never be 100% convinced. There's too much circumstantial evidence that Hal was indeed Satoshi, or one of the largest elements if it were a group:

* Visible in a space that wasn't huge
* ""Communication"" with Satoshi before and after bitcoin release
* Coded most of the early bitcoin stuff
* Neighbour with the exact name
* Degenerative disease that matches the slow disappearance of Satoshi
* Untimely and unfortunate death and the complete disappearance of Satoshi at the same time.

I can see him emailing himself, it makes sense and is a great defence against the feds sniffing around.   When you do this, you purposely change your tone, spelling, etc.  Someone as paranoid as the cipherpunk set would definitely be sending false emails to themselves.  I would have proxied to a web server, that had a vpn to a tor node if i were minting my own currency and was a US citizen.  

I'm pretty sure the private keys are gone from the eden blocks, Hal didn't back them up, his relatives didn't get the instructions to recover them, or they decided they simply didn't need the hassle.  I can understand all of them, the last would have been a big amount of hassle for the family when the feds turn up.

No way near 100% convinced of this, but so far its the best working theory of the identity that fits.  If someone turned round, that had matches on the above (ie. visibility, contribution, explanation/circumstance) then i could be easily convinced, but I'd expect them to sign a message with a private key from that first year if not the eden wallet.  A scammer would be unknown, appear out of nowhere and be unable to sign a message.

When it becomes a group, the issue is that conspiracy falls apart.  The more people involved, the more likely a leak."	1522268037.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.928099	dwexl0u	t1_dwefxat	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87myor/hal_finney_while_paralyzed_by_als_wrote_code_for/dwexl0u/	8	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	8

The narrative that he sent a transaction to himself is sound.

His defence was ""it can't be me because I received the first transaction from this guy"".  Doing a transfer between two wallets you own is trivial, so in no way proves they are different people.  I think if you take the view that he is proving he isn't Satoshi; sending a transaction to yourself makes it less stupid, no? 

Remember, the theory was that Satoshi was a fake second identity for HAL, so if he was already sending fake emails to himself, making fake blog posts, etc. he would of course send fake transactions to himself to further solidify this.

All plausible, and sending a fake transaction to yourself makes sense to keep up the charade.

7739	bitmaincash	"""When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin.""

This could indicate that he was aware of the release before others, otherwise it would be rather lucky he happened to be the first person mining other than Satoshi. Also, quite a coincidence he had also already tried to create a POW currency just prior, *then* happened to be the first person who knew about Bitcoin.

The real question is this: If Satoshi took advice and bug fixes from someone like Hal immediately *after* production, why would he not have sought advice from *anyone* before its release? Logic dictates he would have told someone about his intention, if these records are not found publicly, we can assume that's because it was done privately ergo someone probably knows something.


Edit: I'm settled, Nick Szabo made Bitcoin, 100%. Nick Szabo in his 2005 paper on Bitgold (Yes, seriously) talks about things no one started talking about until after Bitcoin. 
 
These two solved the issue in Bitgold and released it under a new name and anonymous identity. He was a Lawyer at the time and considered creating money to be illegal. Additionally Hungarians switch first and last names, Nick Szabo = Szabo Nick = SN = Satoshi Nakamoto.

The Iraqi information minister said there were no troops in Baghdad, for example, would it be disrespectful to speculate that they were if there were conflicting claims?  He had a motive not to do it, but ultimately he didn't care if you believed him or not, he just didn't want to suffer the consequences.

Anyway, if he has asked people to stop and he is Satoshi, then it would indeed be a sign of respect to not do it.  "	1522270380.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.929098	dwezaro	t1_dwevzoo	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87myor/hal_finney_while_paralyzed_by_als_wrote_code_for/dwezaro/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

If he's not Satoshi, then why insist that he is? In either cases, my opinion is that it is reasonable to stop speculating.

Lastly, Finney [was harassed](https://www.wired.com/2014/12/finney-swat/) up until the very end, because of speculations about his identity. Another reasonable assumption is that Szabo may have had some similar experiences, and he doesn't enjoy them. Satoshi is considered to be a very rich person, so anyone who is believed to be Satoshi at scale is at some degree of risk. Imo, it's not even responsible to try to prove that Szabo is Satoshi if there is a possibility of endangering him.

In the end, it's your choice of course. What you find reasonable may not coincide with what I do. I only suggested that one should reconsider repeating these theories before continuing to do so.

As I said, based on his responses, my assumption is that he doesn't want to be known as Satoshi, so I assume he does not condone activities that go against his wish. Not stopping is one of these activities, so, for me, his actions implicitly encode the same ""please stop"" that you look for. However, I understand that your position is firm in only accepting an explicit request, so this trail of thought does not apply to you. My advice was to rereconsider how respectful it is, and if after going through all these considerations, one still considers it respectful because it was not explicitly requested or any other reason, then that's ok.

I am suggesting this because I know that when I first made my mind about who's Satoshi, I was equally eager to share with others. However, after I reconsidered the situation, I considered it's not respectful to go against their wish and what I believe to be an implicit request.

Picking on a detail like that is absurd, naive and disrespectful. I think Hal should get the credit he deserves. That is why I am passionate about it.

I don't believe Dorian is Satoshi. But it seems Hal was part of the group behind Bitcoin. Together the group is Satoshi, individually they are just themselves, so when Hal was asked ""are you Satoshi"" he could honestly reply no, I am not Satoshi. 

My guess is Hal remembered Dorians name from his interactions when he was a student, it stuck in his head so when the time came for a catchy name for the group Dorians name came to mind.

Not using it as a currency was never mentioned, maybe it has gained that definition now, but it originally did not mean never sell or use, it just meant never sell. So spend and replace and HODL should be compatible, not mutually exclusive.	1522334767.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.941598	dwgo06t	t3_87z5m4	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87z5m4/discussion_hodl_vs_spend_and_replace/dwgo06t/	4	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	4

7886	dalebewan	"From the two options you mentioned, my behaviour is closer to ""spend and replace"".  However there's one key difference in that I don't replace *after* spending BTC.  My behaviour is actually better described as ""get rid of nearly all my fiat as quickly as possible when I get it"" and then spend BTC whenever it's a possibility for something I need/want to buy.

The only fiat I continue to hold is an emergency fund in case of catastrophic failure, plus enough left over from my monthly pay to cover those few payments I still have going out in fiat (which I'm working on replacing with bitcoin).

To be clear, I do have (reasonably significant) investments as well, but the idea is simply to keep my fiat holdings as low as possible since they are the only ""store of value"" I have that is essentially *guaranteed* to become less valuable over time.

I don't view my BTC holdings as an ""investment"" but rather simply as my primary liquid currency.  If I were to rebalance my other investments in some way and end up pulling some money out of it, that money would be BTC, definitely not any of the world's fiat currencies."	1522347606.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.941598	dwgtn0h	t3_87z5m4	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87z5m4/discussion_hodl_vs_spend_and_replace/dwgtn0h/	2	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	2
7887	auviewer	"Once we have lightning enabled mobile wallets is when people are likely to be doing more spend and replace. 

Another issue is that it is still fairly tricky to convert between fiat and BTC. I do think that it is actually easier to accept bitcoin as a business than businesses seem to make out. If I walked into a fancy restaurant ordered my meal and it cost $100 and told them ""sorry I have no credit cards or cash to pay you but I do have bitcoin"" surely that restaurant could easily accept the payment in BTC?

On a vaguely unrelated note, I really think that bitcoin might be a good system for donating to the homeless (the original unbanked ,of course there is  a spectrum). I think it would be easier if people needing money just print out a QR code and if you go past them in the street we can donate them some bitcoin."	1522335224.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.941598	dwgo8fk	t3_87z5m4	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87z5m4/discussion_hodl_vs_spend_and_replace/dwgo8fk/	2	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	2
7888	blargh4	"&gt; Any thoughts?

I think it's a nonstarter. An economy can't swim upstream.  In aggregate, people will follow economic incentives, and bitcoin disincentivizes spending.  The more times it bubbles up in value the more people will regret spending $10's worth on some bullshit like a video game that's worth $500 now."	1522335191.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.941598	dwgo7uw	t3_87z5m4	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87z5m4/discussion_hodl_vs_spend_and_replace/dwgo7uw/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

7890	dalebewan	"In the early 1990s, I spent thousands of dollars on a computer that is less powerful than the phone in my pocket.  If I'd kept those thousands of dollars, I could buy a much better computer now; or get that same computer for next to nothing.

But - and here's the important point - I wanted to have that computer then, not at some undefined point in the future.  This is *no different* to a deflationary currency.  Yes, if people hold on to their money, it'll increase in value over time and they could buy more; but they also will still have wants (and even more so, needs) that they'll fulfil immediately regardless of the opportunity cost.

I expect that a society with primarily deflationary currency would be less inclined to waste money on things that really are crap, but honestly I don't see that as a bad thing in the slightest."	1522347860.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.941598	dwgtr4q	t1_dwgo7uw	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87z5m4/discussion_hodl_vs_spend_and_replace/dwgtr4q/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

7940	thecryptohour	"Well said :) sometimes its easy to get lost in the hullabaloo and ever changing crypto space, and you can lose sight of what really matters.

This post was a nice reminder and im grateful for you saying it. I think we all need to remember what it is about bitcoin that makes us better, and try focus on that more, rather than the battles we find ourselves sometimes drawn into, which just feeds negativity, at least those are my thoughts.

Congrats on your engagement, the new job and im looking forward to chatting more in this sub :) "	1522290609.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.948600	dwfkpxr	t3_87u7pv	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87u7pv/today_is_my_birthday_and_i_just_wanted_to_say/dwfkpxr/	5	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	5

7953	codedaway	"While an individual can spin up 1000 nodes, I'm going to assume each node is an independent person/company.

The more nodes is great but it's who they are connected to that matters (Channels open with unique other nodes).

Channels provide routes to other nodes which help with being able to reach someone else without having to open a channel directly with that person/company.

Widespread adoption is a pretty ambiguous standard as I wouldn't even consider Bitcoin itself to have widespread adoption. Within the niche Bitcoin community, 1000 nodes is still very small but not insignificant, the software is still BETA albiet on mainnet, most larger companies will likely wait until they see it as out of beta to implement it for their customers but likely already started development on their solutions.

So to answer you question, widespread adoption of the LN within the current Bitcoin ecosystem will happen when we see some larger companies implement it as well as slick GUIs/Integrated Bitcoin/LN wallets become the defacto."	1522268561.0	2018-04-01 16:33:01.952600	dwexxzf	t1_dweqygz	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87q2am/1000_lightning_network_nodes_on_mainnet/dwexxzf/	2	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	2

With a stealth address, you ask payers to generate a unique address in such a way that you (using some additional data which is attached to the transaction) can deduce the corresponding private key. So although you publish a single ""stealth address"" on your website, the block chain sees all your incoming payments as going to separate addresses and has no way to correlate them. (Of course, any individual payer knows their payment went to you, and can trace how you spend it, but they don't learn anything about other people's payments to you.)

8040	supersammy00	Yes it would. The more hashrate the more often a block will be found. P2Pool's current round is at 20% which is not out of the ordinary. The past week the average hashrate is ~1PH if you add yours it will quadruple the odds of finding a block. P2Pool is a small pool though and you will have to deal with the randomness of that. When the pool does find a block you will get a big payout but when there isn't a block found you won't get a payout. Slush's pool can payout anytime because they find several blocks a day but P2Pool can only payout when they find a block. It might be more profitable or it might be less on average it will be the same though.	1522328956.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.033099	dwgksp4	t3_87y1ga	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87y1ga/p2pool_mining_question/dwgksp4/	3	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	3

In order to get put on the permanent shared ledger, you have to wait for a miner to take your transaction and ""process it"" into a block, and they will do so based on a prioritisation that takes your transaction fee into account (the more you pay in fees, the higher a priority they will give your transaction). Once your transaction has been incorporated into a block it will appear as having one confirmation. Then after the next block is mined approximately ten minutes later (on average but can vary) a second confirmation will appear, and so forth. After six confirmations your Electrum wallet will simply show a check mark to indicate ""complete"" acceptace of your transaction by the network."	1522360697.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.035603	dwh2pi1	t1_dwgxo5q	/r/Bitcoin/comments/880qif/transaction_unconfirmed_what_is_this_and_what_can/dwh2pi1/	2	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	2

That makes it pretty much a gimmick. Whether they let people pay in Bitcoin that they immediately convert to USD, or people have to convert their Bitcoin to USD then pay, the net result is the same.

Those bills only started as gimmicks to try and increase tax revenue by attracting people with bitcoin.

It's not really solving a problem. They have to pay more fees than if they just required USD, but they figure they will make more money from attracting taxpayers than the small amount in fees."	1522210602.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.053101	dwdresi	t1_dwdhfc6	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87hfwt/reddit_quietly_drops_bitcoin_support_will_no/dwdresi/	7	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	7

Just the other day, I saw the term Web 2.0 and it made me have some weird flashbacks. That term used to be all over the place.

I don't really have a point to this post. It just interests me watching all these companies develop and sustain. I'm curious to see how this Facebook privacy stuff shakes out.

Devaluation of others doesn't necessarily lead to narcissistic behavior, it can lead to a peaceful detente between you and society, one that is likely healthier than the status quo. 	1522214576.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.056102	dwdvtqc	t1_dwdrhs2	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87hfwt/reddit_quietly_drops_bitcoin_support_will_no/dwdvtqc/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

Then they realized most people with bitcoins are more interested in hoarding them than spending them, and the accompanying price volatility makes it pretty useless for business cashflow, so you just have to convert to USD anyway (which costs more). everyone with bitcoin also has USD (or other native fiat) that they can pay in any way, and they'd much rather spend USD than bitcoin. So the only people you end up attracting who wouldn't have just paid in USD are people spending it as a gimmick, which isn't a significant percentage of trade for most businesses that aren't selling bitcoin t-shirts.

Market cap is determined by the current bid/ask price, not the total amount of money put into it. What is important though is that the value you get by selling is not lost by the receiver, we can safely assume both parties benefited, which is why the trade took place. However, if we assume people are only buying due to speculation, then it really depends on when the receiver sells and what the intrinsic value of the bitcoin really is.

edit: If we assume the intrinsic value is zero, and that it will inevitably return to this price, then it is a zero-sum game (actually, negative sum due to the electricity costs, but close enough for the sake of this assessment)"	1522321370.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.063599	dwgf0oq	t1_dwfg95m	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87q6td/212_of_students_surveyed_have_admitted_to_using/dwgf0oq/	2	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	2

If I forked bitcoin a million times would I be a multi-trillionaire? I would, but only if I could convince other people to buy the many forks that I created of it. Let's say I fork bitcoin and call it bitcoin dust, let's say I somehow get bitcoin dust listed on a major exchange. The only way anybody can sell their bitcoin dust is if, you guessed it bucko, there's somebody willing to buy it. The problem is who the hell is gonna buy bitcoin dust? It turns out quite a few people during times of bubbles, not so many people as the hype dies down and more people try to ""create money"" by doing forks. The more forks there are, the more scattered the demand is, and thus the harder it becomes to sell the ""currency"" that you hold.

8375	disgraceonurface	"It can be one of the better ones, especially if you nab something on sale.  Check out r/buildapc, maybe post there to double check if the pre-made you are selecting is a good value.  I'd really avoid giving Best Buy any money if it's possible, many of their products are shit quality and/or overpriced.

If you get brave and want to build your own (it's really just like putting legos together, I swear), you can check out https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/ for a comprehensive list of most Canadian PC part vendors.  r/buildapc can also help you out with the building process.

8376	jorbar0812	Cool thanks for the info! Its been many years since I built a computer so I was contemplating going the easy route since the premium paid on a pre built is less than usual right now with RAM and GPU prices pretty high, but maybe I’ll do some research and compare the prices and wait for the next line up of graphic cards.

tl;dr: Their ""smart contracts"" got hacked, a bunch of people got robbed, and the developers actually were able to roll back their blockchain to before the robberies occurred, which proves Ethereum's blockchain is mutable and centralized.

8638	Acidryder	"Are we actually still worried about the price at this point?

 We have been below the current price recently and new investors or people who believe in the technology got in. Many people who invested in December got out or are holding on for dear life. People who got in early either know the game and HODL or sold to get a nice gain. People sitting on the sidelines are comfortable waiting to see a clear move in either direction. Most weak hands have sold by now.

Long term I believe in bitcoin not only as an investment but as a solid alternative to conservative monetary systems. For any major move upwards, media coverage has to pick up again and we need a few weeks of a solid upward trend.

So instead of checking the price every five minutes I am now trying to do more reading on the tech side and explore how I can actually contribute to Bitcoin and cryptos as a whole. Because ultimately, the motor that is driving bitcoin is the community that has to develop bitcoin into a valid currency for daily usage or a solid store of value.

Where do you see the future? Is bitcoin gonna be digital gold or can it be a serious currency?

Edit: sorry for long text but just trying to get a discussion going that involves more than moon and doom.

At this stage, it's just a massive scam orchestrated by ICOs, exchanges and whales.  

So what is mostly likely to happen next - major shake up.  We will see exchanges like bitfinex and binance ""disappearing"" with customers' deposits, tethers and pumpings being exposed, massive price crashes across all cryptos, regulators stepping in, etc.

Then a fresh start with cryptos that are supported by governments and banking industry and exchanges that are highly regulated."	1522336406.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.246600	dwgosjo	t1_dwggdca	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87qohy/daily_discussion_march_28_2018/dwgosjo/	0	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	0

8670	wardedess	"Well, I was born a bitcoin miner’s daughter
In a house next to my daddy’s alma mater
We were poor but we had love
That’s the one thing that daddy made sure of
He’d hash a block just to make a poor man’s dollar

My daddy would work all night in the cryptocoin mines
All day long, jamming up the main line
Mommy rocked the baby’s at night
And read reddit by the iphone light
And we’d say our prayers to Satoshi Nakamoto

Daddy loved and raised 8 kids on a miner’s pay
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a keyboard every day
Why, I’ve seen her hands so raw
To some we were bourgeoise
But i know our clothes were bought on ebay

In the summertime we couldn’t download any apps
And at Christmas there weren’t no presents to unwrap
And my family saved every bit
Just to watch another currency split
My daddy always complained about the wealth gap

Yeah I’m proud to be a bitcoin miner’s daughter
I remember well our family treading water
The work we done was hard
But a free economy was our reward
I just hope the rig doesn’t get any hotter

Well, a lot of things have changed since way back then
Like the assassination of the Winklevoss twins
Investors used to be galvanized
Now the market is decentralized
Just like the memory of this bitcoin miner’s daughter"	1522286368.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.255599	dwffwi3	t1_dwfeex5	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87ol4h/bitcoin_miners_daughter/dwffwi3/	5	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	5

8677	TheGreatMuffin	"They are kinda separate, yes.  
There are transactions being broadcasted by users, and a miner takes those transactions, packs them into a block and then tries to solve the puzzle. If he succeeds, he gains the block rewards (12.5 btc currently) plus all the fees from the transactions in that block.  

He doesn't actually have to validate the transactions, but if he includes invalid transactions into the block, this block will be rejected by the nodes (and other miners) and the miner won't gain any rewards (he will lose money on the electricity consumption).  

So you kinda can separate validation and block rewards, but a miner has an economical incentive to make sure he doesn't process invalid transactions. It's kinda unlikely anyway though, since an invalid transaction won't be broadcasted by nodes in the first place.

8681	igadjeed	"&gt; Are these 2 seperate?

Separate  
Every network node validates every new block, and validates the transactions inside it  
A block is not considered valid unless it has been verified by the node network  
Most network nodes are not miners  
Non-mining nodes are not paid, they verify blocks for zero reward  

The miners should validate the transactions before they start mining a new block, because the block will be rejected by all the nodes if it contains invalid transactions, and then the miner gets no rewards  

The miner is not paid for validating transactions, only paid for winning the guessing game"	1522300919.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.258601	dwfw1hi	t3_87vdr0	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87vdr0/is_mining_for_coins_different_than_processing_tx/dwfw1hi/	2	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	2

8718	Pretagonist	"Basically every new state in the channel is composed of two different transactions that aren't the same. The transaction you have gives the the other party the funds immediately but has a delay on your funds and vice versa.

So if both parties publishes their states then both parties get their coin on-chain as soon as they are added to a bitcoin block.

Now to the theft protection:

Every state transaction also includes a transaction locked by a secret that gives the the locked part to the other party without delay. And this secret is shared as a part of creating a new state.

That means that if I publish an old state the other party will first get the money they have in that state and then while I wait for my money the other party can and will publish a transaction with the secret he now has giving him my timelocked funds as well.

Every new state in a LN channel contains information making publishing an old state a complete loss for the publishing party."	1522333300.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.264599	dwgn97l	t3_87y4l7	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87y4l7/lightning_network_security/dwgn97l/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

This would lead me to ask: what if a malicious actor wants to publish an old state of the payment channel, but does so only after disabling the victim's node somehow, whether by denial-of-service or some other vulnerability? It sounds like if your node isn't online, you are vulnerable to having old states published and settled on chain.

I guess this matters in practice: how long is the delay?

There will also be watch tower services that you can send your punishment info and they will watch the blockchain for old transactions for you.

A pretty damn bright one.

The Average Joe will always need someone else to be responsible for their finances, or they'd go bust with their whole family tree in a decade, so it's not like banks will just disappear because of Magic Internet Money™.

Bank transfers not being instant is by design, not because it's something that couldn't be done. In fact, SEPA already transfers across Europe within few hours in most cases, and in a day in others, and is going to be instant at some point in the future. Oh, and it's *completely free* to send payments already, no need to wait for ThunderWebwork2.0® to be launched somewhere at some point to make it cheaper.

Also, since blockchain could just be outsourced the running costs could be cut down, thus increasing profits.

Now don't get me wrong, having both the freedom and responsibilities for your finances would be awesome, but it's simply not going to happen the way you think it will. If some crypto will manage to grow to be a worthwhile idea, you can rest assured that the banks will jump on that, it's not like *dey dum* about this stuff."	1522244351.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.308103	dwemaxh	t3_87p5na	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87p5na/blockchain_will_do_to_banking_what_internet_did/dwemaxh/	6	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	6

The only major innovation of the blockchain is that it solves the issue of security. A centralized (bank based) blockchain is as useless as a centralized Internet (where every type of content comes from one source).

To the extend that the blockchain proves to be like the Internet (at all) it *will* harm the banking system. The comparison is apt.

So the scope of people you talk about is 0% of the worlds population, since the people without GSM coverage are inside the group that's unbanked (And at the bottom even of this group).

8908	SpoekplumpeN	Yea, many parts of africa already uses a payment system that uses text messages to update a central database, I dont remember the name right now. They also trade in GSM refill cards and use this as transferable value since they can send the refill codes to eachother in lieu of a bank service. For them the step to using bitcoin is way more natural than it is for us, and much more needed	1522289392.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.309104	dwfjc6k	t1_dwfgq64	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87p5na/blockchain_will_do_to_banking_what_internet_did/dwfjc6k/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

8910	HaoweiShi	I imagine the text messaging bitcoin system being connected to a SPV service and people can request balances/send payments/request addresses using text commands. Another option is to develop an app that directly send commands to the SPV over the GSM network operated via a GUI.	1522289881.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.309104	dwfjw20	t1_dwfjc6k	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87p5na/blockchain_will_do_to_banking_what_internet_did/dwfjw20/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1
8911	SpoekplumpeN	"Yes this is likely how it will work, you can have your account as your phonenumber and easy text uses like ""Pay 100 followed by phonenumber"" in a message to your SPV and he recieves 100 satoshi etc if you only have a old style mobile, or a GUI if you have a better phone, they can work togeather.

As to your second post about africa I also totally agree and do hope it pans out like you imagine it, financial systems being easier to set up and permissionless is always a great thing, especially for the poor. Someone will do it, either for oportunity to make money, take market share etc. Or out of good will.

Where are loans going to come from?  How will people finance their cars, get mortgages, start businesses, go to college without a bank that is willing to lend them money?

My greatest fear for bitcoin alongside government regulation of the crypto-fiat boundary is market manipulation by a collaboration of banks or even governments. The US Gov created a 'Gold club' in the 60's that comprised of several governments. They tried to keep the price of gold below $35 an ounce for about 5 years until they had to abandon the plan as it cost too much. I fear a similar situation could happen to bitcoin... 	1522279513.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.309104	dwf8628	t3_87p5na	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87p5na/blockchain_will_do_to_banking_what_internet_did/dwf8628/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

Another reason why you don’t have a masters in economics. How on earth can you take a look at the 1 year chart and say this isn’t a bubble, and it’s pretty well accepted that 2014 was a bubble as well. 

&gt; No commodity has ever been in a bubble twice within 3 years. 

Even more proof you don’t have a masters in economic, completely demonstrating the lack of understanding of the concept of mutual exclusivity.

As you will find out in the next couple of years, we are in another housing bubble, all within a decade from the last one. Again, also neglecting the very fundamental concept of a mania. Mania is caused by lots of cheap money being available, and poor judgement because people don’t have any real consequences for their actions. A *real* master of economics would know that all bubbles are preceded by loose monetary policies. We’ve have 0% interest from the fed for a decade.

That's why crypto is going to win. We have the arguments on our side. It doesn't matter whether I state them or not, or whether you believe them or not. Government currency will go to zero because politicians always find it easier to overspend rather than raise someone's taxes, until the debt load is unsustainable and no one will loan money to them. At that point the money printing accelerates.

Dismissing something (""paranoia"") doesn't make it go away. The $1.3T deficit with the latest US budget deficit, for example, works out to $4,000 in added debt for every person in the U.S. That's $24K for my family in added debt for just one year. In my regular middle class job before I retired I didn't make enough over expenses to take on that much additional debt, nor do the vast majority of other people. These are unsustainable trajectories - unless the printing presses are run and the markets flooded with dollars at some point to reduce the value of the debt held by government. Once that starts and people lose faith in that currency it's hard to stop the stampede to the exits, hence the hyperinflationary death spiral.

It's no good saying some government currencies are ""sound."" That just means they haven't died yet.

Hyperinflation is a symptom of economic collapse, not the cause of your saving eroding.

The US does have modest inflation. You can google the differences between a stable inflationary currency and a stable deflationary currency if you wish. BTW, there is also stagflation which is very detrimental.

Low inflation does not erode your money unless it is in a mattress or savings account for a long time. Simple index funds will protect you from that.

What you appear to be most concerned about is the National Debt. (Of course, how this is addressed by Bitcoin is not clear)
This is, indeed, a problem. It is not exactly what you say.

It does not make sense to divide the national debt by the number of citizens. National debt is not like personal debt. It is secured by the stability of the US. 

It is not going to “come due” with people coming to your house to collect funds.

That being said, the USD and Euro are special. It is not magic. They are supported by the two largest most stable democratic economies on the planet. The Yen is supported by an economic Superpower as well.

If the USD collapses, you will not be worrying about the value of your savings account.

It is ridiculous to talk about stability of USD in the same breath as Bitcoin.

9043	ebliever	"I don't fully agree. If a government keeps running large deficits there comes a point when it cannot pay its debts regardless of how rosy the economy looks. So I think people who imagine hyperinflation can't happen because they live in a prosperous country have a blind spot. 

If the central bank were willing to let the government financially implode, yes, the currency could survive. But I don't think that's realistic given their track record, and the fears statists have about such a situation. I think they'd try to save it like they did in 2008 as the lender of last resort to a government no one else is willing to loan money to. That would involve a lot of money printing. I know they talk about being able to shut it off, but in a bad situation it wouldn't be that simple. There's no magic way a government can erase monstrous debts (and interest payments) without either draconian confiscation of wealth or a severe impact to the currency.

9044	Dogmaishell	"You keep saying hyperinflation and I don’t think you mean that. That is people with wheelbarrows full of money buying milk. We are not at risk for that anymore than we are at risk for an asteroid or comet.

The currency is secondary to the economy.
You seem to have it the other way around in your head.

If the USD collapses, it will be a result of Armageddon. Not the other way around.
(That does not mean currency policy cannot impact the economy, but you keep mentioning hyperinflation which can only be the result of economic collapse in the West)


A word about national debt. The US owes the debt mostly to its own citizens in the form of T-Bills. Yes, your grandmother is milking the US for that sweet TBill money.

Yes, it is reckless for the governments to borrow and spend like drunken sailors. There is a difference. The US can print more money and back it up. 
And the US economy will continue to grow.

9045	ebliever	"I do mean exactly hyperinflation. There is too much money printing going on to prop up government spending, and at some point things are going to come unglued with that. It will start as an uptick in inflation, but ""with other things to worry about"" that seem more pressing. No one wants hyperinflation, but once things go too far down that path it's extremely painful to stop. I don't see the US government or culture being willing to do what is needed to fix their problems.

Ironically, the USD can collapse now precisely because we have alternatives that we did not have in the past. Which means people who understand what is happening will have alternatives like Bitcoin to shift their wealth into. Yes it will be bad, but it will be the worst for those clinging to unbacked government currencies to the bitter end. 

It's been a long time since the US debt was mostly held by citizens. Do you really think the average American has anywhere near (Edit) $64,000 in T-Bills? That's $384,000 for my family's share if we are average. And that's just the federal debt.

1. If he needs the btc to be changed to fiat instantly he would need a merchant solution like bitpay or coinbase merchant but both of these are pushing altcoin agendas and blacklisting ""bad"" coins etc etc. and currently there is no good all-in-one solution that could be recommended.

2. If it is OK to just receive the BTC and then manually convert it to fiat when needed (for example monthly transferred to an exchange and withdrawn in fiat) I can recommend BTCPay. They even support Lightning Network.

3.

9104	sweetsmellingrosie	Austrian economics were made irrelevant by Karl Lorenz' discovery of the basic concepts behind the science of complexity around the time of Hayek's death. Hayek's hocus pocus about it being impossible to objectively understand systems with many dependant variables (like the economy) led him to put his belief in a way of thinking that used subjective notions as objective realities. One of his greatest blunders was that we could never understand the economy as a whole and that indivual choice extrapolated to mass behaviors was the best way to do this. That completely neglects realities that are true on the individual scale and false on the larger. Individuals may choose to act one way but someone interested in population scale relationships cannot disregard things like externalities to individual exchanges that end up affecting the larger economy. Austrian economics is for simpletons and libertarians today, basically the people obsessed with themselves. Gold is a terrible universal standard of value. It has all these terrible properties like being hoard able and in limited supply, not to mention that a few nations can source it in any quantity. 	1522278904.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.538601	dwf7ica	t3_87sfeu	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87sfeu/the_theory_of_interest_and_prices_in_paper/dwf7ica/	2	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	2

Economics is not a science but it uses mathematical tools that are the product of our scientific achievement. The tools to model complex dynamic systems came out of the 1970s. At that point philosophy was displaced as a pillar of belief by economists that could model the complex system of dependant variables to get an understanding of the whole economy. It serves engineers, meterologists and whoever else in in the business of understanding complexity.

Austrian economic thinking is pretty simplistic. It views men as fundamentally greedy and accumulation schemes as desirable. The reason gold is so loved by them is that it is hordable. They have the hardest time justifying hoarding fiat currency. Libertarians gravitate to this because of a common desire to have and to hold for themselves what they view as theirs."	1522280992.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.538601	dwf9t7e	t1_dwf96z4	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87sfeu/the_theory_of_interest_and_prices_in_paper/dwf9t7e/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

9108	sweetsmellingrosie	Your purchasing power for what?  People today have more purchasing power than ever because of cheap credit. In fact many are making a killing in capital gains seizures by simply owning homes for which they are only minutely invested in. I have never seen a time when it was more possible to get ahead by just holding things than I have witnessed over the last 40 years. People have access to so much money to buy assets with. It seems to me that the ones that bemoan this gift the most are those who use credit to consume and buy assets that decline in value with certitude. This way of having things is cruel to the uniformed, but it is not true that is objectively negative to you. It can be very subjectively positive to you. It was actually worse when things were scarce and money did not flow much. 	1522282301.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.538601	dwfb9mq	t1_dwfab8h	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87sfeu/the_theory_of_interest_and_prices_in_paper/dwfb9mq/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

It's not **your** money.  When you spend money with a credit card it's the **bank's** money you are spending.  When you borrow money for student loans that is also the **bank's** money when you spend it on cryptos.  

&gt; Don’t see them being knights of justice when buying cigarettes with their fiat money

They are in the business of making money not losing it.  When you default on a loan they lose money.  When they are the the ones loaning out their money they are free to put whatever restrictions they want on it.

They have likely figured out that lending money to people to buy cryptos is very high risk with very little upside for them.  People probably borrow the money and if cryptos go up they pay back the loan and if cryptos tank they simply walk away letting the bank hold the bag.

You can buy cryptos with cash, ACH transfers, wire transfers, and debit cards.  The banks are in no way keeping you from spending your own money on cryptos.  They are prohibiting people from spending the bank's money on cryptos.

This statement is completely incoherent. Saving and taking out loans are the complete opposite thing. You take out a loan so that you can spend more now at the cost of spending less in the future. Saving does the complete opposite thing. The demand and need for loans is massive. Companies are able to operate efficiently because they have access to short term credit, and are able to invest because they have access to long term credit. People constantly need loans so that they can afford cars houses, etc banks provide all of these services.

Banks are needed regardless of whatever the currency is. The entire reason they were bailed out during the financial crisis is because a lack of loan availability would have and to a large extend did massively cripple the economy.

Bitcoin is more analogous to and competes more with services like Paypal or Venmo than actual banks.

There is a whole subculture of people who look for ways to do this, so banks usually catch on after a while and shut it down.	1522199428.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.546101	dwdeq9w	t1_dwd2fby	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87ibfd/21_of_students_surveyed_admit_to_spending/dwdeq9w/	3	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	3

9156	MinerDon	"Gotcha.  That makes much more sense.

I haven't been in university here in the states in &gt;20 years but our system is very different.  Some students get scholarships which don't have to be paid back, but not many.

There are federal grants which also don't have to be paid back but they are usually only a small fraction of the total cost of schooling.  

Most of the costs end up being borrowed by the student (and to a lesser extent their parents).  Most of the time the loans cannot be discharged in a bankruptcy filing so once you take them out you are on the hook for good.  

In the states a student would be much better off using money from a credit card to buy cryptos instead of student loans because they can walk away from the CC debt in the event cryptos go to zero.  Both are terrible ideas, but the CC route is easier to get away from in the event of a crash."	1522188370.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.546600	dwd2sut	t1_dwd1qte	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87ibfd/21_of_students_surveyed_admit_to_spending/dwd2sut/	2	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	2

Now many of them are underwater (hopefully not for more than a couple of years, but anything can happen).	1522216342.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.547601	dwdxocu	t3_87ibfd	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87ibfd/21_of_students_surveyed_admit_to_spending/dwdxocu/	2	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	2

No, what's so bullshit is you trying to dictate to them how they spend **their** money.

&gt; I know for myself I can pay my credit that the cc company gave me.

It's not your money.  When you make a transaction on your credit card you are spending the bank's money.  They are fronting the cash.  The bank has no way to know if you plan to pay the balance in full at the end of the month or if you plan to walk away if the price of btc tanks.  They are also assuming all the risk.  If you fail to pay they are the one out the cash, not you.  

Again you can buy bitcoins with cash, via ACH, wire transfer, or use your debit card.  In all those cases it's your money being used to facilitate the transaction.

*****
&gt; In a recent survey conducted by The Student Loan Report, we found that 21.2 percent of current college students with student loan debt have used financial aid money to fund a cryptocurrency investment.

&gt; More than one-fifth of college students are dipping their toes, or maybe diving in head-first, in the virtual currency space, and they are using their student loans to do it.

&gt; Student loan borrowers would be able to pull off such a maneuver because they are given their remaining student loan funds to be used on &amp;quot;Living expenses.&amp;quot; Sometimes, student debtors borrow more than they end up needing for that semester of classes.

In no way do they enforce rules. They don't have the power. 
They are early warning systems and trackers but that is it. 
Miners can't change rules they run the software that was delivered by devs based in consensus. If they attempt to run non consensus approved software the other 18 miners will orphan their block.

9291	djgreedo	"Look here: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Full_node (the section 'Why should you run a full node' in particular).

In short, the more full nodes the better, as they reduce the chance of miners taking over/changing the rules, and individuals running a full node are running bitcoin trustlessly, as it was intended to be used.

As also mentioned in that article, it's unlikely that miners would do something shady, and this appears to be good enough for the bcash community - trusting miners to do the right thing rather than having a network that forces them to do the right thing. When these currencies start to become mainstream and/or more valuable, this might be a critical distinction. The average Joe will not know/care about consensus rules and how mining works...and might not notice if miners decide to stage a coup and increase their block reward.

-------

There is currently a trend among the bcash users to push the narrative that full nodes don't help the network. This is likely because bcash is pushing for large blocks, which make running a full node much more costly (and thus out of reach of non-miners). Therefore, if they claim that running a full node is not useful to the network, it fits their narrative that dramatically increasing the cost to run a full node is not a centralisation risk."	1522179098.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.562099	dwcvqdp	t1_dwcuur6	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87gvbd/psa_lightning_network_node_count_has_exceeded/dwcvqdp/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1
9292	TheGreatMuffin	"This is all mostly true. However, ""the more nodes the better"" is not that simple. If I spin up 1000 nodes on AWS today, it won't matter at all, since they are all on one server and not really under my control. Also, they are not doing anything since there is no activity (actual transactions) going through them.  

A node which you fully control (your own hardware) and which you actually use for incoming/outgoing transactions is more important (mostly for the user than to the network itself) than 1000 idle nodes on an Amazon server.  

An idle node (without in-/outgoing transactions) on your own hardware is actually also not that important, except perhaps for bootstrapping new nodes (and perhaps being of value to the owner to learn about how the network works etc)."	1522179553.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.562099	dwcvzw2	t1_dwcvqdp	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87gvbd/psa_lightning_network_node_count_has_exceeded/dwcvzw2/	6	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	6

9294	Cryptolution	"The more economic activity that goes through a non mining node the more important that node is. Bitcoin is a market-based economy just like everything else and he who has the most money usually tends to win the arguments in Bitcoin land.

Nodes ran by wallet providers or Fiat bridges, for example, have powerful voices even if they don't contribute hash power to the network.

This is why it's important to be your own node and to spend from it. It's important to be decentralized and to not consolidate too much power into others hands especially on a peer-to-peer Network where that's not necessary. 

Running a full node that doesn't have any economic activity still helps for the robustness of the network but it won't prevent a split from happening. It will just ensure that there is a higher node count for the portion of the split economy that it sits on.

The more nodes you have the harder it is to DDOS the network."	1522190271.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.562099	dwd4ob9	t1_dwcuur6	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87gvbd/psa_lightning_network_node_count_has_exceeded/dwd4ob9/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

No there are plenty of sources, in fact there are full academic whitepapers etc that are written about how this all works. I'm on my phone, so just not going through the trouble of finding them because every person that has ever mined or at least has a basic grasp of the economics have a very basic understanding of ""bad miners"" ""51% attack vectors"" ""miner economic risk"" ""miner economic reward"" if you don't you lose as a miner. It is a competitive market and miners are always looking for an advantage, if they could do it the bad way and NOT get caught, and lose everything, trust me they would. The point is they can't. The only way to continue is to play fair. Again, if they could ever gain a competitive advantage and a 51% attack was ever possible they get one chance at it only. If they fail they are screwed, but if they just play ""the game"" they win anyways so they might as well play. Game theory....blah blah.

Agreed a person not using their nodes in a p2p fashion fail. IMHO 80% of the people that started nodes did so because they were told it helps the network. After that it sat running in the background on their computer. They don't actually use it to process their transaction or even validate their transactions it is too much work and humans are lazy.

Miners aren't blacklisted for valid blocks. The bitcoin SW  allows blacklisting to weed out bad actors. This is done actually quite easily. The reason good actors can't be excluded is it requires a 100% consensus to blacklist a pool or specific miners. That is why governments could force one mining company to blacklist another but the other 18+ miners would still validate the block. Wish I had links to those academic papers.

9368	toomuch72	"That is the miners job they validate non mining nodes don't. Miners orphan blocks that do not adhere to rules this is how bitcoin works. Non mining nodes can't do anything to enforce the rules because they do NOT create and write the blocks to the ledger. All that non mining nodes can do is propagate txs to the network. Record transactions until the rules are broken then they disconnect from network and miners then decide to write to ledger or orphan the block. The nodes don't even have to be there to relay to the miners. The current internet infrastructure does that fine.

Edit: you asked how do miners know? They run the same software nodes do. They just do the two extra steps of rejecting or  writing to the blockchain"	1522345205.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.564601	dwgsl5p	t1_dwgqs8u	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87gvbd/psa_lightning_network_node_count_has_exceeded/dwgsl5p/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

9370	toomuch72	Full mining nodes are the only ones that can reject or orphan blocks non mining nodes just don't RECORD invalid nodes. The miners update the blockchain so if their rules don't agree to the non mining rules your info can differ. Non mining nodes can not change the rule directly unless that node is where the miners get their software.	1522194813.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.564601	dwd9jfi	t1_dwd94k9	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87gvbd/psa_lightning_network_node_count_has_exceeded/dwd9jfi/	2	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	2

You would think this would scare Bcash puppets into selling, but the truth is that Bcash's longterm weakness is also their short term strength:  Less users = less buyers AND less sellers.  I no longer think Bcash will die before the next bull run, I think Bcash will continue to trade sideways and then just not gain much during the next run.  It will be slowly forgotten.

So theoretically, they can make BCH look stronger simply by pumping it beyond any increase BTC can make.

So if I had to guess, BCH will make a bigger run than BTC next time around, then be dumped and left to die. The slow dying off seems unlikely to me, though again, it's all a guess. In the end, BCH dying off is what the best result would be."	1522199926.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.564601	dwdfata	t1_dwd19y2	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87gvbd/psa_lightning_network_node_count_has_exceeded/dwdfata/	2	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	2

9387	exab	"Bcash (BCH) in a nutshell:

1. Bcash, aka Bitcoin Cash, is basically a one-man's coin, although he has quite a few influential minions.

2. This man is Jihan Wu. He is owner of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produces most of all miners in the world.

3. Bitmain's miners have a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gives Jihan's mining farms (but not his customers!) advantages in mining, which results in Bitmain's monopoly in mining industry.

4. Covert AsicBoost is unintentionally disabled by SegWit, a newly activated feature with many merits that gets intensively attacked.

5. Bcash was live at the same time as the beginning of the activation of SegWit.

6. Bcash is basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.

7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miner in the world remotely.

7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controls a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.

Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed have solid evidence and are acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.

By understanding who is behind Bcash and what he has done / what kind of person he is, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attack SegWit?

Bcash has few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. Bitcoin has more than 400 developers, of which some are well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which is better without going into any technical detail.

The problem with Bcash is not about the technology at all, although its technology is inferior. It is not even about decentralization, which it fails totally, which makes it totally valueless. It's about it is created by a cheater (AsicBoost) and backdoorer (AntBleed). Few altcoins are more scammy than Bcash.

Bcash does not resolve *any* problem in Bitcoin. It is an altcoin with virtually no users and every altcoin without many users has low fees and fast confirmation times."	1522227610.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.565100	dwe8ewv	t1_dwe80j0	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87gvbd/psa_lightning_network_node_count_has_exceeded/dwe8ewv/	4	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	4

Sounds ridiculous, as it's just downloading an app, buying some bitcoin and sending it to the wallet, and scanning a code, but you have to understand **that requires effort on the part of the user.**

Do you know how hard it is to get mobile payment systems going in the west? Every bank and their grandmother has started apps, gave tons of rewards for using them, etc, and they still get fuck-all adoption despite paying being literalmente' just opening the app and putting it near the card reader and then tapping ""yes"" or ""no"" on your phone.

That requires less effort as you don't need to buy or transfer anything nor secure anything yourself. That gives them rewards for using it and/or trying it. And **it still gets no adoption.**

Anyone saying otherwise has not studied the behavioral psychology of the average person with their money and spending habits. Most people are lazy, complacent, and don't give a fuck to change what they do. This same problem exists throughout all of the west.

In Asia it's different, but relatively problematic just in the same, as why the fuck am I downloading this shit and buying and transferring, etc, when I can just use alipay? That's why something like Omisego is the **only** chance at real world adoption for crypto payments. It needs to be universal, usable by existing mobile-payment platforms, and have a fiat onramp to even have a chance at any real world use outside some memer who buys and sells shitcoins online and acts like he knows about economics."	1522263423.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.572605	dweuwi4	t3_87pi9j	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87pi9j/on_a_scale_of_1_to_10_how_hardeasy_is_it_for_a/dweuwi4/	5	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	5

First you have to come to grips with whats really happening when you buy something with BTC.  The process is really quite pointless because at the moment we cannot use BTC natively, there is always a conversion process involved in every transaction.

The normal process:

1. You use fiat to purchase BTC  
2. You give BTC to vendor to purchase goods
3. The vendor or a payment processor exchanges BTC for fiat

So why not just send you BTC to a service which can credit your fiat debit card and use the card to purchase anything, anywhere.

https://www.livingroomofsatoshi.com

Seems like sacrilege to use BTC in this way, but the sad fact is we cannot spend BTC natively until BTC completely replaces a national currency .. and who knows when and if that will happen, so in the meantime we have to be content with the fiat&gt;BTC&gt;fiat conversion process which almost always operates at both ends of every retail transaction.

9429	snowkeld	"If you walk into a store that sells both bread and coffee as well as accepts bitcoin, then you will take it to the cashier, who if trained to accept bitcoin will ring up your items and present you with a qr code for payment. You would find the easiest method to pay is scanning the QR code with a mobile (private) wallet and clicking send. Your end of the process is exceptionally easy, but you will need to have a data connection of some kind, good thing lots of stores offer wifi these days to help with that. 2/10 difficulty overall given the conditions.

This is including a lot of assumptions, and unfortunately not many stores will accept bitcoin, and some that do will have untrained staff. If seeking out this kind of location is part of the difficulty then it's 9/10 for sure.

Take any fiat currency right now. It is used for purchases as well as for trading, i.e., making money.

Think further: Let's say there is only crypto. I am 100% sure, in the end, there will be more than one currency.

9463	nicmakaveli	"I see your point, but I respectfully disagree. The exchange rate is what gives a currency it's value. This one is just currency to currency. 

And the most convenient exchange rate to compare bitcoin to get a reference for it's value at the moment are Fiat currencies.

This will change as it receives wider adoption.

it's very inconvenient right now to compare the value of btc to say gold. How much is an oz? can you tell me without looking it up and doing some calculations? (i.e. exchanging Bitcoin for dollars and multiplying by the dollar/oz gold exchange)

I bought bitcoin the first time many years ago, and many times, not as an investment. 

To buy things on Agora and similar markets (more groups, and no not drugs but data mostly) anonymously. And to buy things that others would only share anonymously.


BTC was less than a few dollars back then. I never anticipated it to be worth more than 3,4 maybe 5 Dollars.

But I saw the value in using bitcoin. Anonymity, no transfer costs (miners do the verification and get rewarded by this itself in btc), and safety (I know, mgox, agora... but all those shut and run scams will end with wider adoption I believe)

Remember the biggest problem, 5 or 6 years ago? 
Every damn exchange had a different exchange rate. Not 1% difference, 5-10%
If you can't readily exchange BTC, where would it's value be? How would you know what it's value was?
 

I think China's RMB and it's slowly loosening dollar Peg are a good example of the benefits to the valuation of the currency itself (not speaking of the economy of course) by letting the market value it in dollars.

Wherever you see btc going, 2008 is over. It's not going to replace FIAT in our lifetimes. So for it to hold any value and gain value is more people valuing it in other currencies. Higher adoption and ease to exchange will eventually lead us to one day, being able to tell you the BTC/OZ of Gold Exchange rate of the top of our heads.

my 2 cents.

People aren’t buying Bitcoin to change the world, they’re buying Bitcoin because there’s a decent chance that it will change the world. If Bitcoin has any amount of major adoption the price will soar. Guaranteed. For people like me the risk vs reward is worth it. 

Beanie Baby collectors who expected a return were simply hoping that one day their collection would be worth a lot of money despite the fact that there were tons of them being manufactured and they aren’t useful for anything.

Bitcoin has been functioning in a secure and decentralized manner for 9 years. The insane amount of hash power behind it makes it impossible to attack.

Just do the same thing as other sensible parents and save monthly in an index fund.	1522210839.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.689602	dwdroi4	t1_dwdkmz7	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87jt9r/my_wife_and_i_bought_bitcoin_for_our_2_year_old/dwdroi4/	17	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	17

But not because the worlds smartest investors and traders have set the perfect price and there is no way someone outside of Wall Street could do better.

Asset valuation is an imprecise science at best and subject to emotions and a whole host of other externalities.

Most managed funds don’t outperform the index funds on a consistent basis.

Just the fact that you posted about it on reddit unprovoked in your own post  screams it's a bad investment decision. The smartest thing to do for your daughter's future is to sell the bitcoin and more than likely spend it now to give you or your wife a break as most parents are over-stressed because they didn't actually know what kids entail. Just spending it on time away from her to de-stress would far improve her future and the likelihood of her parents being happy together far more than some magical that likely will not even be a functioning blockchain when she grows up (due to electricity and difficulty).

At the very least just stick it in the bank and wait till some true sign of adoption happens, or wait till a certain industry is ready for a moonshot. She's fucking two. **TWO.** She has 16 years before college, which in all likelihood will be free by then due to the increasing socialist climate around the world. But even if not, that's going to be around 2035. Don't you realize how fucking big the space bubble is going to be? You can sit on cash, not even ever use it, or even put it in a savings account for interest, and likely shred any returns anyone else makes by just waiting for the space companies to go public and buying shitloads of them. Bubbles like bitcoin was just in (and likely still is in) come around every few years, and smaller versions every few months. There's no sense in jumping in now when things are uncertain.

He absolutely ***hated*** it there, so he quit his job after a few years of doing it. When he was there, he had to learn everything about computers, even coding and stuff (we still have all his ""Visual Basic 6 For Dummies"" and ""JavaScript For Dummies"" books laying around) and ever since I was 3, I've been extremely into tech. I guess I got his genes.

When I'm older, I'm planning on going to college to be a software engineer, hardware engineer, UX designer, or something else so that I can get a high paying job doing something I love.

9665	DangerReddit05	"Run it past him.

There are different levels of restrictions over various assets - it depends on the bank, and also the individual's role within the bank.

Most of the time, the trading restrictions are limited to single stocks, and even then its a case of getting the control room clearance to do the trade. There are also minimum holding periods (e.g. 30 days) imposed to ensure you are not trading on non-public market sensitive information.

Most banks also have blanket control exclusions (i.e. they don't care) for certain asset categories, for example, OTC trades, spot FX and indexes which are not concentrated in a single stock by more than 5% etc. I would expect cryptoassets to be within a broader category of excluded assets. No harm getting him to flick an email to the bank's control room to get advance clarity on this point.

Serious consequences follow for breaching these requirements, whether it is intentional or not. The bank will need to go through a serious of hoops and hurdles to log a breach, investigate it, assign responsibility, report it to the compensation committee (who will cut his bonus), mandatory reporting to the regulators (e.g. SEC), face potential fines, maybe lose his job etc. Btw, because its a regulatory requirement, they take this shit pretty seriously - doesn't matter if the trade is for $1 or for $1M, a breach is a breach.

Will they ever find out? Not likely, but do you want to run that chance because you couldn't be bothered to send a 2 minute email for clarity?"	1522324301.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.702101	dwghgoc	t3_87ul6h	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87ul6h/can_i_still_invest_in_cryptocurrencies_despite_my/dwghgoc/	2	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	2

In fact, none of the trial could possibly have been proven since corrupt federal agents (later arrested for their *own* crimes related to the Silk Road investigation) had admin level access and could have tampered the evidence to whatever narrative they wanted to portray. In fact, the defense was specifically precluded from even bringing this point up after having made the court aware of the issue.

Freeing slaves is not a good analogy to helping cartels sell drugs and guns. One is about raising the level of freedom to the same status as yours. A pretty defensible egalitarian goal. 

The other is helping pretty unsavory people make a profit by trading addictive products to literally anyone - even if they aren't old enough or competent enough to consent. Organized crime is responsible for a huge amount of death and misery. Not to mention forced prostitution, kidnap, etc...

Why don't you just read https://freeross.org/making-a-murderer/.
Everything is on there. 

“Of the six murder indictments trumpeted by the U.S. government in the days following Ross’s arrest, five have fallen off the table and the sixth sits untouched in a separate indictment (legalese for an unproven allegation) that was purposefully left out of the trial.” 

That one Maryland charge has been untouched for years, and it's about the staged murder of Curtis Green (who has publicly stated he doesn't think Ross ordered a hit on anyone). 
The other murder-for-hire allegations were never charged.

But is there any reason to use this tool at all, when we already have [Diceware](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases) from ~1995, the Cypherpunk-era, as a famed, proven solution in the first place? It's easy to generate a 128-bit secure passphrase by hand using a dice as TRNG in Diceware, and uses it to derive a wallet. Actually, [BIP-0039](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/bip-0039-wordlists.md) is based on this very idea.

Remember, shorting has a lot more risk than buying and holding.  When you buy and hold, you're not risking losses to cover.  Shorting is very high risk.

If shorting was easy risk-free profits, everyone would do it.  I've only shorted bitcoin twice, I had to borrow actualy bitcoin from friends to do it, and I took a shit ton of risk because if the price went up, I'd have to cover those losses with fiat."	1522293690.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.841103	dwfo6hd	t3_87uoa6	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87uoa6/theory_has_bitmain_been_shorting_bitcoin/dwfo6hd/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

10059	Draco1200	"Mt.Gox was the LARGEST exchange that got outed as an essential quasi-scam and blew up causing that drop.      There was no real alternative exchange for people,  at least people in North America to easily switch to;  it actually became a lot more difficult and scarier to Buy for a lot of people, for a while.

So.....  it didn't just  ""drop"";    MANY traders / dabblers lost a major chunk or all of their BTC holdings  and left the scene;  confidence in all the exchanges was shaken.
ATMs and Local exchanges like Coinbase or Gemini that make it easy for people to get BTC from Fiat did not exist yet ----   getting from fiat into BTC  was not nearly as easy,  streamlined, and ""safe""  in 2014 as it is now.

Some understands, some not. For those who doesn't understands, I ask them then to provide me a bank account to pay. So I use those services/friends that pays for me in fiat and I pay them in BTC.

No, that's one of the main criterias of anything that is considered as a store of value. You using it as such doesn't make it a universal store of value.

&gt;It's legally recognized as a currency in a growing number of Countries, so again its your opinion vs facts.

Yes. It's basically meant to be a currency. Yet, today, it's a speculative asset. Those who enter it enter it for Gains and those who believe in it are HODLing, in their own terms. Neither are what you use currency for.

&gt;""Modern civilization falls""? Ok, fair enough. What if the current financial system falls and which is more likely?

Neither is likely. Yet, when you compare with gold, you have to compare in that way. And if the financial system falls, Bitcoin can't be converted with anything. Mass adoption of it won't happen. Countries would simply use their legal power to restart a new currency, even if virtual.

&gt;If they allow crypto at all, they can't stop it. Given the G20 initiative it seems they aren't just allowing it but encouraging it.

Governments have enough measures to track crypto. In fact, hard currency is much less trackable. Which was my point.

You can even install two completely different wallets on two devices, but as long as you use the same private key/seed on both of these wallets, they are ""synced"" automatically.  

The ""syncing"" happens because both of these wallets use the same addresses on the blockchain. You just need to make sure that you use the same private keys on the two wallets. F.ex, you install two fresh wallets (wallet A and wallet B) on two different devices, create a new private key on wallet A and import that key on wallet B. Voila - it's ""synced"" :)  

But you should read up on what private keys are and why you need to keep them safe and secure.  

P.S.: basically every wallet nowadays will create a new receiving address after the previous address has received a payment, it's pretty much the default nowadays."	1522280260.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.853602	dwf901j	t1_dwf7i09	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87sbfp/best_wallet_for_accepting_payments_android_ios/dwf901j/	2	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	2

10192	tyzbit	"Just popping in to correct an inaccuracy in the article.


&gt;If for whatever reason Alice goes offline or fails to respond in another manner, she essentially breached the smart contract and is, as a consequence, penalized by forfeiting her claim to the funds in the channel — even the funds that are rightfully hers.

**This is entirely wrong.**

If one participant goes offline, the channel is unusable for payments or routing.  Bob can try to cheat and transmit an old state where he had more money than Alice but:

1. That assumes Alice doesn't come back online for a certain amount of time.  If she does, she can punish Bob instantly for *all of his funds*.
2. That also assumes Alice didn't contract out the work of watching her channels for cheating to a 3rd party called a Watchtower.  Then even if Alice goes offline and Bob tries to ""roll-back"" a channel and get it confirmed on-chain, the Watchtower is able to punish Bob as well, and could then choose to share funds with Alice if they wished.

Further, when either side tries to cheat, they wager **ALL** of their funds on being able to get _some_ of the other party's.  As an example:

Alice: 1 &lt;-&gt; Bob: 1   Total Capacity: 2

Alice pays bob .5

Alice: .5 &lt;-&gt; Bob: 1.5

Bob goes offline

Alice goes to the chain with the first channel state, which would mean she gets .5BTC back:

Alice: 1 &lt;-&gt; Bob: 1

If Alice succeeds, she makes .5BTC.  If Alice fails _she loses the rest of her initial 1BTC_ since Bob or a Watchtower _can sweep all of her funds_.  This only happens when one side tries to cheat, not go offline."	1522209870.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.858100	dwdqkyi	t3_87hgww	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87hgww/who_is_elizabeth_stark_a_bolt_of_lightning/dwdqkyi/	8	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	8

You're an idiot. The technicals of the bitcoin protocol and blockchain technology are not vague subjective concepts like music quality. Either you understand cryptotechnology or you don't. Bitcoin not being advanced runs contrary to your point.

I can't believe you're suggesting that someone who doesn't even write code and has no technical background (she has a legal education) and has no deep knowledge of advanced crypto concepts **is some secret supergenius who is operating in a different creative paradigm that we cannot understand because she's too advanced**. Your comparison hinges on her being to crypto what Beethoven is to music. 

&gt; This makes Elizabeth a punk.

Congrats... this is the single cringiest thing I have ever had anyone say to me on the internet ever. ""Salesperson who doesn't actually write any code is punk, embodying a sense of anti-authoritarianism, a do-it-yourself ethic, non-conformity, direct action and not ""selling out"" (which is what punk means).""

I'm suggesting Beethoven wasn't considered technically advanced at the beginning. And I didn't suggest Elizabeth was a supergenius, I stated she is not technically poor. But in any event, the idea of 'technical correctness' appears to be meaningless.

Your point carried through suggests bitcoin users who don't code are 'technically poor'. So what?

However, being a true good old fashioned snobby Brit; I'm aware this is a frequent habit amongst new world English speakers (especially the Aussies) so I decided not to let poor translation on my part spoil this.

*****
&gt; According to Elizabeth, the solution of all these issues lies in introducing a second-layer protocol for Bitcoin that defers the broadcasting of transactions to the blockchain, thus allowing for transactions to clear much faster, but doing so in a manner that doesn&amp;#039;t clash with the principle of decentralization.

&gt; So let&amp;#039;s say that the last successful transaction resulted with Alice getting 0.5 BTC and Bob getting 1.5 BTC, and the ongoing transaction was supposed to update the balance to 2 BTC for Alice and 0 BTC for Bob.

&gt; With Elizabeth Stark as the face of the company, Lightning seems to be making its way on the crypto scene, with many recognizing its potential to bring Bitcoin transactions closer to the wider audience.

10267	lbcbtc	"""The CEO as salesperson"" is a common management concept endorsed by many researchers and industry experts. It is the observation that CEOs are in many ways mostly representatives for their organisation and must lead by communication. This is not a controversial statement in management science. Jobs was referred to as the supreme salesperson who drove Apple's rise to success.

Throw in a few stocks and bonds too. Now you are really diversified. You know what you are investing in. Someone else’s obligation. What do they owe you. Trust, faith or anything else that has no substance. This is what they want you to believe. They create a model based on this belief system. The world is filled with systems of trust. And those in charge of this trust system will do anything to keep you from being in a trustless environment. Because in those environments they have no control. 

What Satoshi started is based on a trustless environment. 99% of all crypto is based on trust. Sure they are crypto but someone has a level of control over each one except Bitcoin. And as I said the ones who instill trust will do anything to keep you from being within a trustless system. Diversifying is just one tacit they use.

Absolutely none at all, but that's not what the traders think. To them, in a textbook somewhere it says that if these two lines cross where the 50 is bellow the 200, it means that the market is in a bearish trend. 

Now depending on how many traders actually trade according to these two lines they might cause a price movement. If there are not that many traders believing in these two lines, then nothing will happen.

If you think this is a painful bear market situation you must be new. I ""lost"" quite a bit of money from ATH, and did not bat an eye. Did not buy at ATH this time, but I did buy in early 2014, and had to endure ~2yrs before I got even. Now? My friends are wondering how can I keep yelling ***BLOODBATH!!!*** and being completely emotionally unattached.

The truth is this period of calm is extremely good for Bitcoin. EXTREMELY. And that's because Bitcoin is not yet ready for prime time. No matter how much you cry ""CRYPTO, BABY!!!"", none of the cryptos is ready for prime time. So these months of calm allow

* Businesses to consolidate their UTXOs for cheap

* People experimenting with Bitcoin for cheap

* Devs working AND having a life

* More devs implementing the available solutions

* Core devs focusing on fundamental research to relieve the network even more

* ...


So yeah, this quite times are VERY good for Bitcoin. Anybody who finds the current bear market so painful, I suggest they exit the market now.

- Instantly spend the mining reward (if there is any for you) on new mining equipment to *stay* profitable, at least for some days or weeks.   
- Don't care for the really big players in mining business or you'll eventually understand... It's not worth it."	1522291864.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.945112	dwfm5dn	t3_87uan6	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87uan6/help_me_with_setting_up_a_rig/dwfm5dn/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

&gt; usb drive as cold storage

""usb drive"" is ambiguous  
Flash memory, definitely not, because it is subject to unpredictable, complete failure  
HDD, yes, but keep multiple copies, and check them frequently. Don't find yourself with one working HDD containing your Bitcoin keys, and then disk failure wipes out your fortune  

DVD-R would be better, but the practice is the same. Assume the media will fail:  

* multiple copies in multiple locations

The amount of electricity that it takes to mine is not a set variable. Therefore we will not have power consumption issues.


I am certainly no expert, but this is how I see it. Right now the energy consumption is on the ""high"" side. But as the cost of mining increases (via equipment cost, energy cost, etc) the amount of miners will decrease. (Example: From where I am from a kilowatt hour costs $0.11 non-peak and $0.15 in peak times, it is not as profitable for me to mine as say someone who has free electricity) With the decrease in miners, and effective hash power being contributed towards mining, the difficulty will decrease, and in turn the amount of electricity that it takes to mine a block. The same can happen, but instead of it being the cost of power, it can be the actual difficulty getting too hard for some mining setups.


This will be a constant part of the evolution of bitcoin. Regardless of the price of a single coin. On top of that, you need to take into consideration the halvening. Every four years the reward of mining a block gets halved. So yes, the price of a single bitcoin may go up, but the reward will continue to go down."	1522308387.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.961600	dwg38dn	t1_dwfyf9m	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87vk2p/bitcoins_high_mining_cost_means_it_cannot_become/dwg38dn/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1
10502	biscottigelato	"3 BTC block reward already accounted for halving. If there are $10M+ revenue per block, pretty certain there will be people spending a good fraction of that to mine, be in that equipment or electricity cost. The block difficulty is irrelevant in this discussion as it’s only a mechanism to throttle the average block time to 10 minutes. The difficulty doesn’t play into the economic incentive directly aside from being a by-product of the competitive mining hash rate there is out there, which is a result of the investment in mining equipment and electricity, which again is because of the revenue to be made (bitcoin price x block reward).

Even if electricity is only 10% of the cost, and the operating cost is 50% or revenue, we are still talking about

$32M x 50% x 10% ~= $1.5M per block. That is still a lot of electricity spent to mine a block. Extremely expensive if it’s still a 1MB block 10 years later. Not to mention how burning all these electricity is pretty bad for the environment.

I still don’t see a sound argument on how Proof of Work can be scalable if Bitcoin becomes the global reserve. And this is even if bulk of the transaction goes off-chain to LN...

Would love to see someone make a sound argument against this instead of calling the article names."	1522312134.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.961600	dwg6oqv	t1_dwg38dn	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87vk2p/bitcoins_high_mining_cost_means_it_cannot_become/dwg6oqv/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

But then mentions the crypto ad ban on twitter, seemingly spreading FUD. Next it mentions a financial times article. Which if you read the actual article, is very biased and one sided, and has much of the same theoretical “bitcoin will use too much power and end the world” literature.


Then, the article moves on to talk about narrow money... Which is questionable. Narrow money is any money or liquid asset that is owned by the central bank. This is a very slippery one. The article is pretty much stating that all of the bitcoin that people own is actually owned by the central bank. Curious. To my knowledge this is false. But hey, I'm not an expert. The math that goes into the $10M per coin is stating that by 2028 ALL of the narrow money in the entire world will be in bitcoin. ($210T divided by 21M bitcoins =$10M per coin. I mean I'm all for mass adoption, but with the state we are in currently, I find it very far fetched to see bitcoin becoming the only currency used in only 10 years. As bitcoin is often compared to gold, lets use the market cap of $7.8T. Which would put bitcoin at $370K per coin (thats 58 times the current market cap).


The halving is inaccurately represented. Current block reward being 12.5, with a halving every 4 years (one in 2020, 2024, and then again in 2028) would make the block reward in 2028 1.5625 btc. This goes to show the lack of understanding and/or research from the writer. After this point, all of the math is off due to the above two issues (bitcoins price in the year 2028 based on narrow money, and the halving being wrong)


The article also uses the digiconomist to quote a few different points regarding the cost per transaction, and the operational costs (math is off due to the above points I have made) Take a look at the digiconomist, which is also very biased and only shows one side of the story. While I was on the site, I noticed a stat that was tucked away. Bitcoin's electricity consumption as a pecentage of the world's electricity consumption: 0.26%. Not very high when you think about it.


So I do apologize for calling the article names. However, it is hard to see any value in the article. I think that it is also naive to say that block difficulty is irrelevant here. Lower block difficulty=less hashing power needed to mine a block=less electricity needed to mine a block. If the hashing power is lower in 2028 than it is now, the whole article is irrelevant.


I'll explain this more thoroughly. If the cost of mining out ways the profitability, then people will stop mining. This will drop the hashing power, and in turn drop the difficulty, which will then drop the amount of electricity that is needed to mine each block. Now, you are saying that if someone is making $10M per bitcoin, why would they not mine, in turn creating more hashing power, and using more electricity. But the answer is above. As someone dumps more hashing power into the system, the difficulty will go up, and other miners will not be able to compete and will stop mining. As they stop mining, the hashing power will decrease, etc. Etc. Etc. As I said, this will be a constant part of the evolution of bitcoin. In fact, this was just talked about in detail. Back in February, when the price was approaching $4-5K. At the current difficulty, mining bitcoin was slowly becoming less and less profitable. If a certain price was breached, there would have been a massive reduction in miners, because it would not have been as profitable. This in turn would have lowered the hashing power. The same thing applies on the way up, however the space becomes a lot more competitive.


As I said in my last comment, I am not an expert. I am sure someone else can come along and use more technical terms and further answer your question. I am also sure that this is not the only or final solution. There is a team working on bitcoin currently, finding solutions for problems such as electricity consumption. Maybe we will see a fork over the next couple of years with an increase in block size. Who knows. Another way I could see this being “fixed” is government regulations in the form of each household is only allowed a specific amount of electricity to be used towards bitcoin mining. However, this would obviously present its own set of problems."	1522321310.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.961600	dwgeysi	t1_dwg6oqv	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87vk2p/bitcoins_high_mining_cost_means_it_cannot_become/dwgeysi/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

Unlike fiat currency and stocks, it's difficult to manipulate forever as long as more people are coming in and buying and retaining their portion.  Manipulators can't just create more bitcoin out of thin air, so the more folks that believe in bitcoin over time, the more stable the price will likely become over time.

It's still too young.  There are still too many billions of people who don't know about it or haven't touched it.  There's a lot of volatility ahead.

Profit from this by making a habit to buy small amounts each week.  I've been buying 0.015 BTC every week just in 2018.

10591	ZepCoin	All mining nodes are continuously trying to add a block of transactions to the chain of blocks with the greatest Proof Of Work. If the network is cut in half, then two chains will be maintained until the network mends. At that time the chain with the least amount of POW will be abandoned by all of the nodes that become aware of the higher POW chain. No miners want to spend $ on electricity to add to a chain that is about to be abandoned, and all miners are highly motivated to take the most likely path towards claiming a block reward on the chain that they estimate to be most likely to win.	1522239938.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.986101	dwejgrs	t3_87m3ta	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87m3ta/in_a_network_segmentation_how_does_bitcoins_proof/dwejgrs/	2	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	2

10596	tripledogdareya	"The PoW is a block header, linked to the previous block header by inclusion of its hash, that when itself hashed satisfies the difficulty requirements of the chain. Once a miner has done the work of finding such a block header, it is broadcast to the network.

Consensus comes not from any one node or block, but from the accumulation of work proof, demonstrated by the network's approval of a chain of such headers and signaled by the majority of hash power being expended in its creation. The need to accumulate work proof is behind the requirement for multiple confirmations. Observing consensus is a probabilistic exercise. Only once you have seen sufficient demonstration of accumlated work proof can you be confident that it must be the product of the majority of work output and, consequently, no other source of work could out proof it."	1522214389.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.986101	dwdvmn7	t1_dwdur4l	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87m3ta/in_a_network_segmentation_how_does_bitcoins_proof/dwdvmn7/	6	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	6

10619	SmokingHorsey	"I see a lot of naive people here. I know it’s important to avoid FUD, but saying things like “We’re still up from last year” is just not wise. There has been a serious amount of damage done to the market. If you look at the all-time chart, the rise and crash we are experiencing looks a lot like what happened at the end of 2013. The only difference is that the peak was way higher this time.

I have no doubt that BTC will be worth a fortune in the long-run, but that does not mean we will not endure another major bear market before then. 

Hopefully there’s another bounce that fires us back up and maintains it’s momentum. I’d love to see that. However, BTC is not your friend. It does not owe you anything. There is absolutely no reason that the market could not callapse temporarily as it has before. 

I’m just waiting for the people who HODL all the way down and then claim “Guys it’s still up since 2011?”"	1522258544.0	2018-04-01 16:33:02.994101	dwesst4	t3_87h6qn	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87h6qn/daily_discussion_march_27_2018/dwesst4/	2	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	2

Hodlers who choose their cost average prices wisely with small % strikes at these buy in points are the real winners. If you have no capital on the sideline then you will no longer be a true hodler if you keep checking the price... you will wilt.

If you have one more receiving transaction, you have yet another new key and the party who is sending you bitcoins will just see their transaction appearing on it.

So people agree to the consensus of what is called Bitcoin. Most likely there will be three chains in your scenario. The third chain would do nothing. And most likely people don't upgrade because they need time to verify the changes.

But does Russia have the motive to do such a thing? Does it align with their motives? Certainly it does on both of these counts.

The Times is a long established publication and their article is sourced, with names and links. This article, on the other hand is simply crying ""fake news"" and has a single person behind it: Artyom Kozhin, Russian Deputy Director of the Information and Press Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry.

If we're to believe a single unsubstantiated denial from a mouthpiece, then fuck, why don't we just go directly to the Iraqi Minister of Information for our news?"	1522233238.0	2018-04-01 16:33:03.071145	dwedup3	t3_87kv94	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87kv94/russian_link_to_venezuelan_digital_coin_deemed/dwedup3/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

10872	eleven8ster	I suppose I'm having trouble because this is the tough part. Someone's gotta come up with a unique use for this. But I suppose if I'm understanding this, someone can create a business from allowing others to use certain functions of their business. So like more cooperation will spring from this because the monetization is simplified and new? Certain types of data can be charged for in satoshis and because millions of users are possibly involved it could add up. Also, could this reduce ddos attacks? Could someone on an attacked site start charging for API calls from certain ip addresses that exceed a set amount of calls per second or minute? Am I understanding this?	1522233813.0	2018-04-01 16:33:03.072645	dweee12	t1_dwedcgz	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87oc7z/trying_to_understand_paypercall/dweee12/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1
10873	askmike	I think this isn't for your average website to charge money to your end users, a paywall would probably work better. This is a replacement for any type of technical service your app could use, for example: database hosting providers such as AWS could use this protocol to charge per query (which usually go over a REST API already). This way you don't have to pay AWS every month in USD through your account anymore, you can build it completely anonymous on a pay as you go basis.	1522237649.0	2018-04-01 16:33:03.072645	dwehpj8	t1_dweee12	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87oc7z/trying_to_understand_paypercall/dwehpj8/	3	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	3
10874	eleven8ster	"So how about a streaming service? Artists are paid per stream a few satoshis and instead of servers streaming to millions of people the artists stream from their personal computer setup or a locally based server company? So the ""Spotify"" acts only as an aggregator of streaming locations with minimal overhead because no servers. Small acts could stream their stuff themselves and get paid directly per call and larger acts could hire services that are smaller and could be pushed around by leverage because they aren't owned by Facebook and won't be able to take as much money from the artists like Spotify?

10875	askmike	"It's not innovative at all and I don't think that's what people are claiming. A company called 21.co has raised millions years ago from VCs with the idea of doing the same thing specifically for bitcoin.

It just never worked because of high onchain fees.

paypercall is just a programming library geared towards web developers: You don't need to understand any crypto/bitcoin/lightning stuff to take lightning payments  inside your api. Similar to how they also came out with a Wordpress plugin to take lightning payments for your woocommerce store. Tech is not very innovative but it will definitely help with adoption on the merchant side."	1522237366.0	2018-04-01 16:33:03.072645	dwehhef	t3_87oc7z	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87oc7z/trying_to_understand_paypercall/dwehhef/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1
10876	iskin	If they're blowing it all on cryptocurrency then they're dumb. However, buying a bit now could be nice for after graduation. I've always thought that if you're taking out a student loan then getting the bare minimum and starting a little business is a good idea. Why not also invest a little in cryptocurrency. 	1522195255.0	2018-04-01 16:33:03.073649	dwda1df	t3_87jbyx	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87jbyx/a_surprising_number_of_college_students_are/dwda1df/	3	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	3
10877	_Marni_	"Why not get the absolute maximum possible? Especially as the interest on the loan is less than that of a savings account, the payment terms are great compared to commercial alternatives, and you also have the option of getting an additional commercial loan after graduation should you need it.

Putting as chunk into crypto sounds like a great idea to me."	1522215557.0	2018-04-01 16:33:03.073649	dwdwuyp	t1_dwda1df	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87jbyx/a_surprising_number_of_college_students_are/dwdwuyp/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1
10878	iskin	Crypto is still highly speculative. You're talking about putting a large sum of money into something that could easily half the total amount. Student loan money is a very cheap loan and its not the worst thing you could do but spreading it into something like a side business that can generate revenue would be better because you'll learn more and have something to show/experience if crypto doesn't live up to the hype. 	1522228313.0	2018-04-01 16:33:03.073649	dwe93ad	t1_dwdwuyp	/r/Bitcoin/comments/87jbyx/a_surprising_number_of_college_students_are/dwe93ad/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1
