Problem is, it works like start-up equity. If you have very little equity in BTC, there's no point working for free to try and increase your equity through making the platform better. You end up going on to make a shitcoin and try to get rich off that. It's all about getting rich - very few people in the ecosystem actually here to destroy the banking cartel and restore individual financial sovereignty to the human race. Simply about money - that's it.

Unless people shelve their greed and shitcoin delusions, and start developing for Bitcoin, things are going to move very, very slowly.

Things that should have already been implemented (they have been a topic of discussion for over two years now!):  
- MAST  
- Schnorr Signatures  
- Lightning  
- Implementing the best features of the top 10 competing cryptos to welcome greedy shitcoiners back into the fold  "	1522517153.0	2018-04-01 16:00:10.969401	dwkn70i	t3_88hk5b	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88hk5b/what_are_the_biggest_hurdles_you_think_bitcoin/dwkn70i/	22	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	22

&gt;Things that should have already been implemented (they have been a topic of discussion for over two years now!)

This is fucking absurd.  Do you have any idea how much complexity just one of those projects represents?  This is a financial system currently storing $120B in value.  You don't play fast and loose when you are managing billions of dollars. It's why many legacy financial systems are still running on 40 year old+ mainframes.  Bitcoin has the equivalent of Michael Jordan's dream team of coders, cryptographers, p2p network experts all working on it.  Things will be done when they are done, and if someone is unhappy with the rate of progression, they should instead chip in their time/money/skills to make it happen themselves.

20	all_the_keks	"- exit scams, spoofing, wash trading, exchanges busting their own customers on margin, etc

- here's a good one:  bitcoin can only handle 3 transactions per second. Now, multiply that by the length of a human life in seconds. Then divide by the number of people on the planet. Tell me: how many transactions per lifetime can bitcoin handle if it is successful and everyone is using it?  (post up your calculations please)

- the fact that after 10 years of bitcoin and 30-something years of distributed consensus databases no practical use has been found for blockchain

- the fact that no one* is using it as a payment system, and everyone is using it as a casino with virtual horses   (* for large values of zero)

- transactions may or may not complete

- if they do complete it might take days or weeks

- vulnerability to attacks (hacks, one miner already having control of 35% of mining, etc.)

- transactions might cost $20 or $0 depending on the mood of the market... oh wait, that's just the tip! Actually every single transaction costs $100s when we include the people subsidising each transaction block by paying miners for their coins...  $100s!!! wtf. The calculation here is:  Number of bitcoins awarded per block mined * cost of a bitcoin in USD divided by number of transactions per block. Do the calculation, post up your results please. 

- daily volatility of the value of your payment is up to 20%.... what ? Imagine if your paycheck at work had that kind of volatility of a monthly basis, never mind a daily basis. 

- the fact it is inherently worth less than zero (due to the expense of maintaining the network) and serves no useful purpose that isn't served by existing fiat currencies

- it is not anonymous, unlike paper cash

- the fact that after ten years the only people who find it interesting are crooks and the desperate poor

- the fact it is ruining the environment with vast amounts of wasted energy

- fraud/theft are non-reversible

- Groupies. With cash/bank/visa etc I don't need to listen to whiny 20-somethings telling me how staring at their balance gave them stronger erections or whatever. 

- For example, you know what isn't a thing? /r/ordinarybankpayment, /r/iusedmyvisacardtodayanditworked, /r/walletfullofcash

- No need to worry about being tricked/trojaned by 'helpful apps' etc with online banking.

- No need to try and read white papers and figure out what the fuck is going on with cash, banks etc. It just works.

- 60% of cash in the world isn't owned by some random fucking mystery guy and his 30 buddies. 5% of the world's cash isn't owned by one random guy.

Now compare all of the above against e.g. making a bank transfer at your bank (in europe, this is free, almost instant, and reversible in the case of fraud) or a payment on your visa/masterard (again, in europe at least, this is free, instant, guaranteed against fraud or poor service).

Oh and you know what I don't need to worry about when I pay for something with cash, bank payment or visa? The IRS/tax authority coming and demanding a capital gains calculation and tax payment, which IS a problem for bitcoin that will never go away.

Anyway best of luck to all you bitcoiners and you are all welcome to come join us over on /r/buttcoin when you see the light :)

If I were making the graphic, I would take all 365 or 366 days in a particular year, and sort them largest to smallest.  Then start down the list from top to bottom, trying to figure out how few it takes to exceed the combined gains for the year.  

That is what it appears that they did for 2013, and 2015-2017.  But 2014 makes no sense.   If 2014 was a down year, all it took was the top ONE day to exceed all days combined.  Yet they show ten days for some reason.

Be realistic. there is nothing to earn from being good. you can earn money only with little criminal traits. Criminal is not shooting someone dead. Smarter as the government than you are often also criminal where they can not get a view. just being good does not pay and is boring too. The government also belongs to the group of criminals.

I replied that I did not do a fuck and paid no fuck tax. And black money is money too.

But not only against agents.

Have it also right in the face of a tax bailiff who came about a car whine that I have not had for 3 years, where 1 bill of road tax was still open from 3 years old. that it just feels wonderful to have something that they can not pick from you and never pay them a penny for it.

243	WorldLeader	"From the Lightning Network white paper:

&gt; If all Bitcoin transactions were conducted inside a network of micropayment channels, to enable 7 billion people to make two channels per year with unlimited transactions inside the channel, it would require 133 MB blocks (presuming 500 bytes per transaction and 52560 blocks per year). Current generation desktop computers will be able to run a full node with old blocks pruned out on 2TB of storage.

Despite the fact that LN is just a clearinghouse where parties agree to settle the full amount later, there's *still* a huge roadblock given that the most optimistic case requires bitcoin to hard fork up from 1mb to 133mb and that everyone caries around over 2TB just to store the ""pruned"" blockchain.

Perfect information across all nodes comes at the price of speed and size. Unless we use some variant of quantum entanglement to break the current laws of physics, it's just not feasible to build a perfectly uniform, instant, omniscient network. 

With centralized networks, only one node needs to be fast enough to store and accept new information, while all other devices can be trivially underpowered. This is how VISA can process 45,000 swipes per second."	1522514265.0	2018-04-01 16:00:11.003899	dwkm41g	t1_dwklghy	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88ejhv/perfect_time_to_be_buy/dwkm41g/	0	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	0

246	Uvas23	"Bitcoin is improving its throughput by gradual degrees. Even now, the network can handle quite a bit more txs with the increase in segwit adoption and increased batching than it could last December. LN is starting to expand rapidly now that it is out of alpha. No one has any idea how much tx pressure the LN will relieve. It is impossible to know how many txs are being made through the LN network right now.

There are more improvements in the pipeline such as schnorr sigs. These will possibly increase capabilities by another 30%. 

As time goes by, each percentage improvement added will increase tx limit by larger and larger amounts. A 30% increase of 3 tx per second will give 1 additional tx per second. A 30% increase of 9 tx per second will give 3 additional tx per second.

So, projecting this outward, in a few years a new improvement that increases efficiency by a few percent will give an increase far more than what the total network can handle right now.

These things take time. There is not going to be a quick fix to the tx limit problem. But it will improve at an ever increasing rate."	1522532755.0	2018-04-01 16:00:11.003899	dwkuqs2	t1_dwkm41g	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88ejhv/perfect_time_to_be_buy/dwkuqs2/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

260	Mahboioi77	I did just buy some around $6.9k, though I don't think it's out of the question to see $6k or even $5k over the next few weeks. Some people are predicting that it will go even lower. This has to be nearing the bottom though. Remember that the fundamentals have not changed. We saw what the price was capable of, and this is just the beginning. I have no doubt that in a few years the price will be over $20k again, if not much more. Buy what you can now.	1522527513.0	2018-04-01 16:00:11.004900	dwkrho5	t3_88ejhv	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88ejhv/perfect_time_to_be_buy/dwkrho5/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

It is definitely the result of manipulation, and I'm guessing the manipulator is short and will have to buy back all the coins they sold to drive it down like this.

387	threefingersoneleg	"Anybody in crypto funded it with fiat
unless it was gifted to you. They always think in terms of turning it back.
Try to think of a world with no fiat
It’s coming sooner than you think 
There is and continues to be gazillions
of fiat being printed out of thin air
worth less and less every day unlike most crypto
Fiat is falling more than crypto is and the dollar is doomed
Just look at real estate for example
And you ain’t seen nothing yet
You can’t compare fiat with crypto
Crypto is the emerging exchange
It can’t be thought of in terms of fiat
if you see the big picture 
Invest in your future if you see one
Never put in anything you can not afford to loose as a result of wanting to go back
Is this ringing any bells ???

I used this platform of fortune 48hoursbitcoin.com exactly 16:00pm Wednesday and got my payout today. Exactly 48 hours later.
I was sceptical about it at 1st because of the bad comments on here and how evil the world can be but then life is all about taking risk and I grew enough balls to take it and boom my bitcoin got doubled in 48 hours. It is a legitimate company guys!! You all should benefit from this now the price of bitcoin is a bit low.

What I’m noting is that this is a clear articulation of a notice with the only purpose of generating any connection between Elon and crypto.

And yes, with some few  exceptions, this has became a low quality sub. Just look at the top post of everyday. Mostly users more worried about the USD value of the bitcoin. 

What an irony! We are here trying to disrupt the monetary system while celebrating USD earnings!

769	964d72e72d053d501f29	"The question is not if the market cap will increase, but how much it will increased compared to other sectors and the market as a whole and how much volatility it has.

Since crypto is so volatile it needs a higher average ATH growth to justify the risk, unless it can on average grow faster than other sectors with growth potential it is now wise to invest more than a portion in it.

If crypto grows to 5 Trillion (adjusted for inflation) in 20 years it will probably not have been the best sector for long term investments.

Even if crypto has the best growth of all sectors the next 20 years it will be good to only have a certain percentage of the portfolio in crypto at any time."	1522486424.0	2018-04-01 16:00:11.082899	dwk4o6j	t1_dwk3kqh	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88eu69/this_is_probably_the_last_dip_we_are_looking_at/dwk4o6j/	2	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	2

Bitcoin has been trading in a range and going lower and lower.  A couple days ago I told my buddy I thought bitcoin was gonna hit 6500.  A new 3 month low.  It did.  If on this rebound it exceeds 9000 I do think it will start going higher.  I would bet against it.  I imagine it will cap out a little over 8500.  If on this rebound it doesn't exceed 9000 it will go lower than 6500.

Bitcoin is ahead of it's time and there are only so many uses for it.  It is good for drugs, hackers, and dodging sanctions or war.  Hackers and war are about the same thing.  This means the chances of regulation are high.  Which ever coin can dodge the law is going to win.  I would bet against Bitcoin.  I like Monero myself.  266 billion seems super high to me even though I think demand for a war/crime cryoto is in excess of 2 trillion dollars.  I am not convinced that countries like Russia and North Korea can feel confident enough in Bitcoin to invest heavily enough in it at this time.

The only question to solve the problem now is:
How confortable you are with the psychology of risk and control in your life ? 

If you are confortable with risk and don't care about absolute control: buy now and live your life. You'll cash out in 3 years. 

If you are not confortable with risk and don't care  about control: leave the cryptospace asap.

The community around crypto fucking sucks, and it drives people away faster than any price dip.

It's so fucking pompous to be like ""Well you shouldn't have invested more than you could handle 🙃"" to someone who is like ""this sucks, I lost money"".

You want adopters? Stop being dicks. Bitcoin isn't an investment platform, it's a new currency.

Sorry if you're looking at a loss on paper right now and feel burnt... but don't take out your anger on people who are still happy with their investment and quite frankly a very amazing technology.	1522471284.0	2018-04-01 16:00:11.099898	dwjrm3p	t1_dwj8jxd	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88a0i9/dont_let_the_negativity_get_you_down_the_future/dwjrm3p/	3	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	3

Now even the stupidest person can use the internet. Block chain is the same way and when the technology catches up to where the mouth breathers can benefit our investment will pay off. That being said if you aren't strong willed enough to stand with us and Hodl for a brighter future without centralized banks and control than please just sell so we can buy bitcoin at a valued price before it skyrockets back up in price 	1522450963.0	2018-04-01 16:00:11.100401	dwj6mw0	t3_88a0i9	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88a0i9/dont_let_the_negativity_get_you_down_the_future/dwj6mw0/	14	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	14

877	RudelyOutOfContext	I'm also very positive about blockchain's future and technologies adapting to it but I don't see how bitcoin's value will be directly linked to it. If for a example banks or goverments (like Venezuela) will adopt to blockchain they will use a own 'coin' that will be linked to your (old) FUD balance not bitcoin. Somehow bitcoin-investors think it's also an investment in blockchain technology. Truth is, the code is open and there is no centralized part in bitcoin that holds any physical or intangible value. In my opinion the value is completely derived on communal trust that bitcoin will be worth more tomorrow than today.	1522458262.0	2018-04-01 16:00:11.100401	dwjebye	t1_dwj6mw0	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88a0i9/dont_let_the_negativity_get_you_down_the_future/dwjebye/	15	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	15
878	kernelmustard29	"The beauty of Bitcoin is not the blockchain or even the crypto. It’s the decentralization, consensus rules, and fixed supply. 

Blockchain is worthless without a valuable token as a reward for securing the network.  Many of the “next-gen” blockchains, like tracking chickens from the egg to the market, would be better suited for a traditional SQL database. 

Government issued and controlled cryptocurrencies are just digital currencies, like the electronic money in your traditional bank account. They’re nothing new and they’re certainly not transformative. 

The fixed supply of bitcoins is the main reason why they are valuable. Scarcity drives demand and demand correlates to higher value.  Many of the altcoins that have no cap (or a ridiculous cap) are going to leave their fans holding the bag as cryptocurrencies go mainstream. 

The reason Bitcoin is valuable is because it is transformative. It’s scarce, it’s secure, it’s decentralized, it’s peer to peer, it’s trustless, and it’s ruled by consensus.

You're trying to put the genie back in the bottle. You don't look back when you are progressing. Microsoft and Steam don't want to go back, and I don't blame them. This is the kind of stupid sentimental bullshit I'm seeing all over this subreddit now that the sky is falling.

Relax, everything will be fine, but it's going to take longer than you hope. The **future** of Bitcoin is a back-end to the lightning network. It's going to be a few months (at least) before this tech begins earning the trust it will deserve. There's still at least one major gotcha that needs addressed:

As far as I can tell, the biggest problem is that the client now has to deal with channel state information, which is a job that should be on a server, but putting info like that on a server undermines the trustless nature of the whole thing, so we're back to square one. Nobody can make a straightforward, usable client with the actual benefits of a digital currency (e.g. your money is an abstract concept that isn't tied to a device) without solving this problem first.

That doesn't mean it won't work out. Technical problems always have technical solutions, and this is the first generation of software devs who are aware of trustless technology, making them qualified to solve this simple problem. It just means the necessary hoops must be jumped through by our fearless devs before the price chart starts mooning again.

You ought to read the article properly and refute the specific issues brought up. All you did was demonstrate an unwillingness to even listen to critisicm after the introduction.

To answer the specific part where you stopped reading, the point here is that a monetary system has to have maximum reliability.

1039	pilotavery	"So proof of space is exactly what it sounds like. They have computations that are extremely difficult, but you only have to do once. For example, the hash that instead of producing 256 bits, it is 1mb each, which can take 5 minutes on a graphics card. The network generates a ""ticket"" of a random series of numbers to solve, and the length determine difficulty. Each person saved the seed used to generate the 1mb block, so they scan the hard drive for that sequence. If it gets a hit, it submits the seed used for the block and the position they found it in. That way it uses next to no electricity to scan a SSD. It also reduces centralization of miners, because it doesn't cost anything. Sure, some will buy huge mining drives, but people who just have leftover space on the computer will let it be used to mine with, and then will automatically delete when you use more space.
Basically, the solutions are way too hard to solve real time, so you just prove you solved it in the past and prove you have the hard drive space. The point of mining is to prove resources that are finate, and space is finate and proving you did the work and maintained the space.

This is just different, the more space you have, the more votes you get. Each 1mb hard drive space is a ticket, instead of each 1 SHA256. 

The person who computed the most has a higher chance, but isn't automatically the winner. 

It's exactly the same, except instead of lottery with GPU power, it's a lottery with HDD space.

The other part of the price equation is predictable too, but more psychology... like good news usually means price drop... Also, btc cant please everyone and someome is gonna get their feelings hurt; from the average Joe, to large institutions...

Not really. Difficulty determines the break-even point and difficulty follows price.

&gt;Either way, miners need to break even, and we all can count on that for a little comfort regarding btc value.

No. Miners have no control over price. The market does not care if they get a ROI. Miners do need to break even, but a falling price just means inefficient hardware gets shut off. There is no pressure from the miner's side that can keep the price from falling more."	1522538233.0	2018-04-01 16:00:11.117398	dwkyzkx	t1_dwkhm6m	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88gioi/is_it_still_profitable_for_miners_to_mine_btc_at/dwkyzkx/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

Profitable? It depends how long you think your mining equipment will last. If you want it to pay back the purchase price in 8 months, then it's not profitable

That assumption makes no sense. If mining becomes unprofitable, miners will leave, the hash rate will decrease and the difficulty will fall  

No sign of the hash rate decreasing so far, therefore the miners are not leaving, so they must be optimistic.

Well then, since Europe runs the whole world...

Seriously though...anyone publishing personal information to an immutable blockchain should understand that they're creating a permanent record. The onus is on them.

Most courts base judgements on the basis of what a person may find to be reasonable. I.e. law is interpreted it is not taken literally unless its an extreme case.

That's why case law generally leans on precedent.

Prosecuting someone is akin to fitting a square peg in a round hole. E.g. the law will clearly state the rules, whereas a crime might vaguely fit some of those rules.

In the world of criminal law there are two things that need to be clear. Mens rea and actus reus. I.e. did someone do it, and did they intend to carry out a crime?

In the case of holding a copy of a blockchain, all you can prove is that they have a copy of the blockchain. You can't prove that they intended to commit a crime on the strength of them simply having a copy of the blockchain and in pretty much all cases, the holder of the copy intends to commit no crime.

Therefore, a sound judge and a crew of intelligent lawyers would not pass a judgement against the use and/or ownership of a copy of an immutable blockchain via GDPR.

Finally, is GDPR a threat? No. GDPR is a regulatory framework (the hint is in the name) designed to help organisations and individuals understand what data they can hold, how long they hold it and the rights of the people the data came from.

This is sensationalist bollocks. The author of this article is a twat and doesn't understand how the law works and can't tell the difference between a criminal law and a regulatory act.

Then they'll buy it when it starts going up again to ""make money""? lol some people just don't learn :(."	1522536295.0	2018-04-01 16:00:11.131903	dwkxees	t1_dwkx1ba	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88izws/why_sell/dwkxees/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

For normal people with a LN wallet they lifecycle will look like:

* Spend Channel
* Close Channel

It was never meant to replace receiving funds for normal users, it is just meant to make paying someone instant &amp; secure because 0-conf is fundamentally broken and always has been.

This is why we built an invoice system: you provide me a request for payment, I pay.  There is no offline receipt without trusted third parties (though Schnorr will enable invoice reuse, so you could have an unsolicited payment).

The only good news is that the  trend towards always being online in some form is in our favor here. I can eventually see a system where your phone gets a ping to complete an incoming payment, not to mention IoT style lightning nodes.

Not exactly true.  The touted benefits of the LN isn't just instant transactions, it has been sold as a method to scale Bitcoin.  LN transactions are supposed to be much cheaper than Bitcoin transactions and if the mempool is perpetually clogged with a fee market (as planned) ""eventually"" can turn into never.

If after the layer 2 solutions and the segwit/batching/merkle/and so on we can't keep the mempool low we will have to increase the blocksize. The point is that a blocksize increase gets more effective the more we work on mitigations now.

LNs will not scale bitcoin by themselves, they are just an important piece of the puzzle.

Getting a transaction into the next block can always be expensive, getting it into the next 10 or so blocks should never be. LNs help the instant transaction needs, for less time critical applications there are other solutions as well as direct on-chain transactions."	1522533464.0	2018-04-01 16:00:11.232396	dwkv8ml	t1_dwkta27	/r/Bitcoin/comments/88dw2o/clarification_requested_can_you_or_can_you_not/dwkv8ml/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1
