71	highdra	"Not even close. Some people jumped in because they wanted to buy drugs on the internet. Some people were privacy zealots that didn't necessarily want to do anything illegal (this was before Monero - Bitcoin is still much more private than any digital payment system before it), like the cypherpunks. Some people are libertarian Ron Paul types that love the idea of a currency that isn't controlled by the government. Some people were looking to be protected from inflation. Not necessarily to increase in value, just to maintain it. Some people are tech heads that saw how digital currencies can solve real world problems, and went to work building systems that increase efficiency and make the world a better, richer place. Some people bought bitcoins thinking that eventually they will be very valuable and will be able to buy lots of stuff with them. 

Then there are the people who jumped in because they wanted to turn a sum of fiat money into a larger sum of fiat money. The people in this group tend to think that everyone who owns bitcoin is part of this group. They don't know that most of the other groups are hoping and waiting for them to get burned even if it sets them back a bit."	1521440545.0	2018-03-18 21:46:49.814120	dvwullg	t1_dvwdvna	/r/Bitcoin/comments/85bjc7/meanwhile_when_theres_blood_in_the_street/dvwullg/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

I invested somemore yesterday, a decent amount in the 7.6 to 8.5 range. And now looking and thinking I am an idiot b/c I could've saced all that I've spent over the past 48 hours, drop it all on the current price and potentially made/saved hundreds. 

But if it jumped back above 10K before I made that move. I'd be kicking myself for missing that chance. The volatility is fickle. I guess you have to just buy when you know it's dropped enough to justify buying and hold on. Of course I boy in the  a bunch in the 8Ks yesterday thinking the bounce back will be very soon, now I feel dumb. In 2 weeks it could be at 14K and it'll seem like the prudent move to have made, OR, in 2 weeks it's at 4 or 5K and I need to show the patience of a monk, believing it'll find it's way back to into 5 figures eventually.

2) Put a pin in the moment between selling it and re-buying it. At that moment, your decision is identical to someone who never had any. You have 0 BTC and are considering buying some at a given price.

But what if you believe BTC is worth more than 20k, and you've invested the amount you are willing to risk against that belief?  You know BTC has a history of volatility; it crashed a similar percentage in the past when it hit 1k.

It's simply an expected part of the rise to whatever the actual value is, and if they tried to time the market and go short at 20k, that would be an incorrect action according to this belief, as it could easily have risen in this time period instead."	1521390971.0	2018-03-18 21:46:49.814120	dvvvkn9	t1_dvvutcg	/r/Bitcoin/comments/858n7c/mood_currently/dvvvkn9/	3	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	3
167	fuzzylogic22	"You could say the same thing about buying at 20k, though. Assuming the drop to 7k is equally unknown to both the potential buyer and the potential seller that both believe the value to be more than 20k, the decision to not sell and the decision to buy are the same from a game theory perspective.

But you have made a decent point here, as the buyer has no choice but to buy in at a higher price if the expected future value makes it worth it, while the potential seller has no reason to sell without knowing about a drop. So this comes down to options on the table, I suppose, rather than abstract game theory.

&gt;The danger here is you are likely to take on greater risk with the windfall—increasing the odds that you are going to make a bad financial decision with the money.

Hindsight bias, also known as the knew-it-all-along effect or creeping determinism, is the inclination, after an event has occurred, to see the event as having been predictable, despite there having been little or no objective basis for predicting it. It is a multifaceted phenomenon that can affect different stages of designs, processes, contexts, and situations. Hindsight bias may cause memory distortion, where the recollection and reconstruction of content can lead to false theoretical outcomes. It has been suggested that the effect can cause extreme methodological problems while trying to analyze, understand, and interpret results in experimental studies.

Greed. 

When you enter a volatile market, you understand that there will be ups and downs, but that your overall goal is to come out ahead. Focusing on price highs with 20/20 hindsight is at least an irresponsible, if not a downright stupid, position to take when investing.

&gt; Crypto is in a lot of trouble.

Maybe for someone who got in a couple months ago, cares about nothing but the price, and expects to leave soon. For anyone else, this is factually wrong; the market is orders of magnitude larger than it was 1 year ago and since any time before that too, and the technology has matured tremendously, and can compete more than ever with traditional currencies.

&gt; It’s time for people to be realists and accept discussion on negative trends instead of labelling it as FUD and dismissing it.

What is there to discuss other than volatility? Nothing new there, other than to say that volatility has been decreasing overall. A large factor here is of course market size. Small markets are vulnerable to volatility.

As always, in a bear market, the best thing to do is to take the time to research and reevaluate your position: ask yourself why you are in this market. If you don't have a better answer than ""the price went up and strangers on the internet promised me it'll keep going up"", you know you shouldn't be investing."	1521420611.0	2018-03-18 21:46:49.814120	dvwc6gw	t1_dvvt1yq	/r/Bitcoin/comments/858n7c/mood_currently/dvwc6gw/	6	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	6

My question is this; one bitcoin is still worth $7k. That’s great and all, but what the fuck can you do with a bitcoin right now that makes it worth $7k? 

There’s not a lot you can do with bitcoin today (based on adoption) that you can’t do with anything else and the only reason it’s worth so much is because people have speculated that it may be in the future.

If people want it to grow in the long term they need to start framing it as a revolutionary currency instead of an investment.

We might have seen the end of the ride down

📊Lowest Volume Since Nov📊

When evaluating the 1 yr log uptrend (the one that broke last week) we were looking at the candle closes - as opposed to the wicks. It's not necessarily right or wrong, it's a matter of preference; as long as you’re consistent. That means you shouldn’t connect wicks to candles and visa versa. 

We used the candle close because the wick from hitting the $6k bottom was a capitulation point and the bounce was massive. We figured if we dropped below that trendline it'd be a great short opportunity, and boy were we right. There’s been 13% downside since that trendline broke. Another profitable short.

With all that said, if we use the wicks to draw the uptrend, you'll see that we're now right on it - technically the 1yr uptrend is still intact, though we’ve been in a downtrend the last 91 days...but who’s counting 🤷‍♂️

Today Bitcoin saw the least amount of volume it’s seen since late November. It’s about half of the volume average of the last 30 days. The last time volume was this low, the BTC price (and therefore marketcap) were almost exactly the same.

If we bounce off this uptrend and find consistency at this level of volume, we could finally be in for some consolidation - some sideways price action. 

This is what we need to see before we can expect any major move up👍"	1521395405.0	2018-03-18 21:46:49.814120	dvvx5e0	t3_858n7c	/r/Bitcoin/comments/858n7c/mood_currently/dvvx5e0/	3	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	3

&gt; LONDON, March 18 (Reuters) - FSB (Financial Stability Board, FSB), which coordinates financial regulation for the countries of the G20 , on Sunday rejected calls from several countries who called for regulation of cryptomonnaies like bitcoin .
&gt; 
&gt; The FSB, however, stressed the need for greater international coordination in monitoring these rapidly evolving technologies, which still represent a tiny sector equivalent to less than 1% of global gross domestic product.
&gt; 
&gt; ""The first assessment of the FSB is that currently, these crypto-assets do not pose a risk to global financial stability,"" said Mark Carney , president of the FSB, in a letter to finance ministers and governors of central banks, which will meet in Buenos Aires on Monday and Tuesday.
&gt; 
&gt; Mark Carney, who will leave his post next year, when he resigns as Governor of the Bank of England, noted that his successor would oversee a regulator more inclined to review existing rules than to set up new ones.
&gt; 
&gt; In his letter, he also said that the FSB, which has conducted a series of banking and financial reforms after the 2007-2009 crisis, will focus on the current rules rather than design new ones.
&gt; 
&gt; ""As the work of the FSB, which aims to fill the fault lines that caused the financial crisis, is nearing its end, the latter will focus more (..) on the implementation and rigorous evaluation of the effects. reforms approved by the G20, ""said Mark Carney.

367	bearCatBird	"&gt; Why is it so low

""People don't think bitcoin be like it is, but it do."" 

Translation: There are too many things in the mix that affect price so it's anyone's guess. In general though there is a loose macro pattern to bitcoins price (bubble, pop, consolidation, growth, repeat). The current price is not in the bubble phase right now. Beyond that, theories abound.

My guess? Different types of people jump into bitcoin for different reasons at different price points at different parts of the bubble cycle. Low prices attract strong hands, High prices attract weak hands, and after every bubble there is a shakeout period. And as the market cap of each bubble grows compared to the previous, it takes even more strong hands to hodl on, maintain a price, build a foundation, and allow the next bull run. We might be in a bear market for longer than the 2014-2016 period. Perhaps this time it is 8 years for the balance to be made.

&gt; isn't this large fluctuation a sign of instability to the point where it couldn't be a viable currency?

Your question is too imprecise to give a meaningful answer. So instead I'll pose some questions.

- What's the difference between currency and money?

- What is ""instability""?

- If bitcoin's instability is more stable than other currencies (Bolivar, for example) could it still be considered a currency? What about a useful currency?

- In the history of economics, how often are new currencies created? What are the different ways currencies are created? When is the last time your country went from one currency to another currency? Was it pegged to a pre-existing currency? Was it a completely free-market currency? What was that process like?

We are in uncharted territory with all of this. No one can see the whole picture. No one can tell you why the price is low, with any certainty. Also, I like the brainless hodl shit. :)"	1521439942.0	2018-03-18 21:46:49.829746	dvwu1s9	t1_dvwn5jr	/r/Bitcoin/comments/85b23g/tell_em_rocky/dvwu1s9/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

371	MrRGnome	What's brainless about a long term strategy versus a short term one? It's only brainless because you say it is. If all you see is an investment or a get rich quick scheme you probably shouldn't hold, you'll rekt yourself on dips like this one. If you see a new kind of protocol for creating trust, the way people who engage this as a technology instead of an investment do, it becomes much less brain dead to take a risk and hold it as opposed to blindly guessing what it's going to do tomorrow.	1521417964.0	2018-03-18 21:46:49.829746	dvw9v3w	t1_dvw40yp	/r/Bitcoin/comments/85b23g/tell_em_rocky/dvw9v3w/	3	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	3

396	Miz4r_	True. I've gone through several bubbles and subsequent bear markets and this one is pretty weak compared to the ones I've hodl'd through. It feels somewhat similar to the April-August 2013 bear market although that one was still a bit worse percentage wise. Price will have to drop to around $3.5k for it to be equal, and BTC recovered pretty quickly back then from such a 80%+ drop. Who knows how long it will take this time, but I have patience and seen much worse so I'm not worried at all.	1521437644.0	2018-03-18 21:46:49.829746	dvwrvf3	t1_dvw9ndy	/r/Bitcoin/comments/85ay1x/serious_question_and_i_dont_mean_to_get_anyone/dvwrvf3/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

If this is your reasoning, then you should be very aware that there is an upper bound. This time (around end of the year during its ATH) the parents of my wife randomly brought the topic bitcoin up.

Firstly, it didn’t. Secondly, people’s involvement isn’t binary: your in-laws may have bought 0000.1BTC or a larger amount but perhaps next time they will have retained the ability to invest more confidently.

399	Geofinance	That's very true, however, I've also noticed that although all these random people brought up the topic, very very few of them were actually informed on how to buy bitcoin. So this wave, really just brought a huge amount of awareness to the scene and not necessarily although of buying. Now that a a new group of people are aware to get into cryptos in general, and of course buying cryptos becoming easier and easier everyday (such as robinhood) the next bull run should technically be even more violent than the previous.  	1521441612.0	2018-03-18 21:46:49.829746	dvwvknf	t1_dvwjd3q	/r/Bitcoin/comments/85ay1x/serious_question_and_i_dont_mean_to_get_anyone/dvwvknf/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

Edit: Just for those who might not be aware, in June 2011 it went to $30 and crashed down to like $2 and didn't surpass that previous ATH again for nearly 2 years.  Then it ran up to over $200 in April 2013 and crashed to around $65, and then we had the bubble up to $1200 7 months after that.

416	loveisdead	"I wouldn't say there's 'nothing.' What follows is my opinion:

First, the bubble did burst and I'm sure plenty of people lost money. Everyone I knew who was interested in crypto was interested because they wanted to make ridiculous returns in a short period of time for their investment. Now that things have changed from ""you'll make money hand over fist"" to ""well you might lose money, or you might gain some money"" people are less interested. They could return if another bubble occurs, but generally, they'll be more careful. The reality is that people were buying crypto because it was a way to make money on an investment, like a stock, not because they thought they were going to be able to purchase their morning coffee with it.

Second, crypto got a lot of bad press that explained some of the very real dangers of putting money into crypto as an investment. 

Two examples that stick out in my mind:

Last week tonight - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6iDZspbRMg

New York Times - https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/05/technology/virtual-currency-regulation.html

Bottom line is that people now know its volatile and what some of the more sophisticated actors are capable of doing.

Third, a lot of the services that helped people enter the market have been caught doing some nasty stuff.

All of this adds up to a risk/reward issue for potential investors. People, in general, are more aware of the risks, which makes the likelihood of another bubble lower. 

The potential of the technology as a currency is great, but the global phenomenon was a get-rich-quick hysteria, and now that people have gotten burned, they're less likely to try it again for a while.

As a currency, Bitcoin doesn't need to have a value of $20k. What it really needs is to stabilize so that it can actually be used as a currency where the risk of holding that currency is low. Given the plethora of ways the value can be manipulated by people with enough coins or P&amp;D groups, I'm not sure how that stability is going to be achieved.

I'm just hoping I can buy a graphics card in the next 6 months for a reasonable price where the MSRP for a 2 year old card is lower than its debut MSRP."	1521413987.0	2018-03-18 21:46:49.829746	dvw6ky4	t1_dvw2z69	/r/Bitcoin/comments/85ay1x/serious_question_and_i_dont_mean_to_get_anyone/dvw6ky4/	10	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	10

There was no big fundamental event driving that crash other than the parabolic rally preceding it, though it was triggered by Mt. Gox freezing up under excessive load (as it tended to do at the time).  Parabolic rallies tend to overshoot, resulting in proportionally large crashes/corrections afterwards. 	1521445333.0	2018-03-18 21:46:49.829746	dvwyviq	t1_dvw2z69	/r/Bitcoin/comments/85ay1x/serious_question_and_i_dont_mean_to_get_anyone/dvwyviq/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

But out of scientific curiosity, what exactly happens when another currency crashes? When BTC goes down, everything goes down. When an altcoin dies, it's usually a drop in the ocean. Tether claims to have a market cap of ~2.2 billion (as of March 2018) but unlike other coins, this is supposed to be backed by USD and theoretical perfect liquidity. If it comes crashing down, everyone that traded BTC/altcoins for Tether are just to be at a pure loss. Will it shake faith in cryptocurrency in general?

426	ZZ4ME	"Here is what will likely happen if the CFTC or SEC brings the hammer down:  Those who hold tether will head for the exits.  There are three exit paths: Tether Limited, Kraken, and other crypto.  I doubt Tether Limited will be jumping up to hand out $2.2 billion, so that leaves Kraken and other crypto.  The market has every appearance of being rigged on Kraken, but you can't hold back the ocean with a broom, so Kraken will be flooded with sell orders, and either the price will collapse to almost nothing, or they'll halt trading, which will probably have the same effect.  My guess is that they'll just let it slide.  That leaves other crypto.  Tether holders will try to immediately trade into other crypto, and prices will probably spike initially.  However, people aren't completely stupid, and pretty quickly no one will trade their crypto for Tether.  Because about 20% of bitcoin trading is done in Tether, a huge chunk of potential bitcoin buyers immediately evaporate.  People who hold crypto will recognize this and sell, triggering a massive sell-off.  I wouldn't be surprised to see the crypto markets cut in half, or worse.  Moreover, the stink of this fraud will damage the perception of crypto, and the markets will be in a funk for quite some time.  Think Mt. Gox, but worse.

463	DeucesCracked	"None of that is really all that indicative of anything other than lesser mania. Our previous bull market was *not ever sustainable.* That was an insane run which may never be replicated, or it may be multiplied, or there could be a smaller one - but don't *expect* anything like it.

Bitcoin is popular in places where people feel turbulence. The USA, no matter how bad things get, always *feels and seems* stable. Our President defends pedophiles and commits treason and we focus on basketball. Our two greatest military potential opponents develop new weapons technology and take territory and murder political adversaries and we whine about snow and cholesterol. Banks steal our entire economy and we say, hey, cool, look - a new payment app.

Seriously, we look out for #1, period, and compete with everything else. In Europe, Africa, Asia where you can have a legitimate need to transfer between currencies frequently or deal with economies that have violent swings and can't get everything you need for your businesses from one nation then crypto makes perfect sense to you. In America we can drive in one direction for days and days and days and still find anything we need or want and pay for it with greenbacks and use our one card on anything and have it delivered and etc., etc.

What crypto needs is USA adoption. For that to happen we need one of two things: Something with great demand that can only be bought with crypto, or something with great demand that gives a huge crypto discount. Like if Tesla said, ""The new model 4 is only available for Bitcoin until nobody is ordering them with Bitcoin anymore,"" or, ""The model 3 now costs 25% less if you pay with Bitcoin.""

465	Flytingtiger24	I agree. These measures taken together point to a stark downward trend in crypto interest. Because so many people got burned investing on the high, them and new investors will be much more sluggish to enter the market, even if crypto does begin to increase. Were not going to see the explosion of investment that we saw in December. That means a much longer crawl for bitcoin to get out of bear territory. What price would indicate to you guys that were out trouble? for me it would be $15,000, in which case I think we have a long wait. 	1521423934.0	2018-03-18 21:46:49.829746	dvwf9e6	t1_dvw2l7f	/r/Bitcoin/comments/85ay1x/serious_question_and_i_dont_mean_to_get_anyone/dvwf9e6/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

There's no guarantee that the next bear market will be multiple years long (in fact, that was the longest bear market in Bitcoin's history and a bit of an anomaly in this respect). 

To quote a comment of mine from a little over three months ago:

&gt;[The one prediction I do have to share is something no one wants to hear right now: this incredible exponential price growth we've been seeing in Bitcoin *will* end, and the market will correct downwards *violently*. And I don't mean a 20-30% drop, I mean a 60-90% drop, where true despair sets in and everyone who hasn't been through a Bitcoin bear market before (and even some who have) feel the other side of holding Bitcoin. Many will sell every satoshi they own, and say ""I knew it was a scam all along"" and kick themselves for ever getting involved.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hplk4/remember_if_you_only_knew_last_weeks_lottery/dqtpiv5/)

&gt;[It's ugly, it hurts, it puts you in a bad mood that you can't seem to escape, and it's coming. I don't know if the drop will come after a top at $12k, or at $20k, or even at $30k, but I am confident beyond confident that it will come sometime in the next few months. It won't be the end of Bitcoin's amazing growth (though it might feel like it), so those who truly take the long-term outlook will benefit from it...](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hplk4/remember_if_you_only_knew_last_weeks_lottery/dqtpiv5/)

Bitcoin has a habit of shooting up a few thousand percent, and then going through a significant retracement to find a new (higher) price floor after doing so. The ""bear phase"" (like we might be entering right now) is what makes [Dollar Cost Averaging](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp) a particularly intelligent acquisition strategy, because you wind up getting a relatively large stake during the interval that prices are low.

So while trolls tempted by schadenfreude are predictably going to come crawling out of the woodworks, remember that the price being ""low"" represents a buying opportunity if you're in the game for the long haul.

490	20kevin20	"We always have regrets during these violent cycles: ""I could've bought cheaper"", ""I could've sold earlier"", etc.

We really cannot accurately predict crashes/booms every time as unexpected things almost always happen. What we, crypto enthusiasts &amp; ""veterans"", know is that it will not be the **end** of Bitcoin or cryptocurrency, it's still in its infancy BUT we have seen an unbelieveable rise of market caps, prices, total amount of crypto investors and a rise of the number of existing cryptocurrencies like never before.

I think it's naive to say cryptocurrencies will never go down. Any market has its falls and rises, but it's almost impossible to have an investment that will get you profits forever.

I don't want to convince anyone to sell, buy or hold, but I'm sharing my thoughts on this so-called ""crash"". I will keep holding and buying although my total portofolio is 8x smaller than just 3 months ago. Look at all this immense projection of prices and the extremely rapid growth &amp; adoption of cryptocurrencies. This is a different kind of bubble than those of real estate, fiat &amp; other industries.

EDIT: Take my message only as a personal opinion of mine. I've been through most BTC cycles and I took most of the wrong decisions during price plunges or extremely high rises. So I would rather not take any action and leave my portofolio untouched until it's over.

Draw a straight line underneath connecting the lowest points, this is the support line that is likely never to be crossed (not for a long time, anyway.)

Anybody who worries about Bitcoin's price should learn a little about how charting works (instead of downvoting anyone trying to explain it.)

534	jchang23	"The past year has been a very humbling experience for me with bitcoin. I learned that unlike with stocks that you have a chance to predict its move based on a whole host of things, with bitcoin, I cannot predict anything at all in the short term.

So why am I holding on to it? Because long term I do think that it will be just as a common as a way to pay like credit cards are today, and with a finite amount, it would have to keep increasing in price. 

In the past 6 months alone, the innovation has been incredible, and there is the compounding effect going on because so many are getting involved in this space every day. 

In 10 years from now, its either bitcoin is gone or its worth a lot more than it is today. Do you think it will vanish? Do you think if it survives another 10 years the price will be where it is today? 

Not everyone is pro bitcoin, however, some very smart people who have a good track record at predicting tech trends, fully support it.

The whole full blocks and high fees were not good for bitcoin. The adoption rate surpassed the development. And good development is really hard. 

If we can have a year of good development allowing exchanges to update their backend technology to keep fees low, it means in the next hyped bull run, bitcoin will outshine the rest.

569	apeweek	"Best way to evaluate the ""danger level"" is to look at a long term exponential chart, like this one:

https://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#tgCzbgBza1gSMAzm1g20za2gSMAzm2g365zxzi1gNVIzi2gMDXzi3gMomentumzi4gMACDzvzl

If you draw a line (or hold a ruler) connecting the lowest points on the chart, that's Bitcoin's long-term support line.   It's very unlikely the Bitcoin price will go below that line.  

Look how far away the price got away from that support line in 2013.  That's what made it dangerous - the 2014 bear market took the price all the way back down, and it was a long way, so it took quite a while.

Look at the same situation today.  The biggest risk, going all the way down to that line - assuming we got there on a gradual slope (like 2014) instead of a sudden crash - would probably take us to $4000 - $5000.   But even at that level, Bitcoin's lowest support line should take the price back near $10,000 by the end of the year.

So worst case, we end the year where we started the year, and have our next big rally in 2019."	1521443288.0	2018-03-18 21:46:49.829746	dvwx3bd	t3_85ay1x	/r/Bitcoin/comments/85ay1x/serious_question_and_i_dont_mean_to_get_anyone/dvwx3bd/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

G20-FSB rejects calls for cryptocurrency regulation

18/03 | 19:36 | By REUTERS

LONDON, March 18 (Reuters) - The Financial Stability Board (FSB), which coordinates financial regulation for G20 countries, on Sunday rejected calls from several countries for cryptocurrency regulation, such as bitcoin .

The FSB, however, stressed the need for greater international coordination in monitoring these rapidly evolving technologies, which still represent a tiny sector equivalent to less than 1% of global gross domestic product.

""The first assessment of the FSB is that currently, these crypto-assets do not pose a risk to global financial stability,"" said Mark Carney, president of the FSB, in a letter to finance ministers and governors of central banks, which will meet in Buenos Aires on Monday and Tuesday.

Mark Carney, who will leave his post next year, when he resigns as Governor of the Bank of England, noted that his successor would oversee a regulator more inclined to review existing rules than to set up new ones.

In his letter, he also said that the FSB, which has conducted a series of banking and financial reforms after the 2007-2009 crisis, will focus on the current rules rather than design new ones.

""As the work of the FSB, which aims to fill the fault lines that caused the financial crisis, is nearing its end, the latter will focus more (..) on the implementation and rigorous evaluation of the effects. reforms approved by the G20, ""said Mark Carney.

But he's also been humble enough to say it's far from an exact science since there are way too many external variables affecting all this (hence his revised prediction above).

Bottom-Line: Long term fundamentals with the technology and infrastructure being built around it has never looked better and with the millions of ordinary people signing up and learning about all this in Q4 last year, and the massive exponential growth we've seen with r/bitcoin subscribers (which is often ground zero for bitcoin outreach)... It seems with a little more maturation on the UX side of all this and layer 2/3 tech roll-out (which is happening a lot faster than anyone expected) 2018 may be the year bitcoin finally ['crosses the chasm'](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*KIXz2tAVqXVREkyd.png).

- Is there a technology roadmap in place for addressing current bottlenecks that are throttling growth and user uptake?
- Is the general public beginning to see advantages to using this technology to solve real world problems?

- Are we delivering better UX solutions and fixing problems that have so far blighted user adoption (Marketing Scams/Get Rick Quick ICOs/FUD ads)?

Whilst we are all eager to see ""moon"", I think it's worth keeping this in mind when things seem to be stagnating: ""An invention has to make sense in the world it finishes in, not in the world it started."" — Ray Kurzweil"	1521444183.0	2018-03-18 21:46:49.829746	dvwxvng	t1_dvwx9si	/r/Bitcoin/comments/85cwwj/tom_lee_predicts_bitcoin_to_reach_91000_by_march/dvwxvng/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

637	LewissunnCrypto	"Yeah, but they took many more with them :) In reality it's a win for the HOLDERS

 There were actually more than 300 greeks there, only 300 Spartans. The Spartans all stayed until their death though due to their religious and loyalty beliefs.

The final 300 were also accompanied by two other states of Greece. I believe one was ""forced"" to stay due to previously surrendering to the Persians and letting down other states while the other stayed to prove their worth to the Spartans. Keep in mind that at this time Greeks didn't consider themselves as a whole, it was rare for the states to work together unless necessary and conflicts were common. It was only after the invasion of Xerxes that greek alliances were more common.

All in all the Persians wore little to no armour, their shield could stop arrows but it was basically a wicker basket so a spear would tear right through. The Persians also had shorter spears and varying training from very little. There was also an issue of communication of the Persians, being from a wide empire they spoke multiple different languages.

In contrast, the Greek Hoplites wore either bronze or ""lamellar"" armour, both are either expensive or relatively technologically advanced. These could stop arrows, spear blows and sword slashes. Their shields ""the hoplon"" would also be bronze with wood internals ( the hoplon was especially significant since the type of grip used within it allows for much easier control of the shield to the extent that it can be used as a weapon.). Their helmets were also bronze and covered most of the face.

Most hoplites weren't too heavily trained but the Spartans were specially trained; taken to what is called the agoge at a young age ( I think around 7 or 9 ) to train for battle until adulthood.

Finally the greeks also chose the position which they held wisely, being a much smaller army they picked a narrow pass which the persians had no advantage over them despite their millitary size.

In the end - Greeks whoop some lightly armoured persian ass until some dude tells the persians how to get around the mountian, persians get behind and whoop some greek ass. Persians move on and whoop some more metallic ass untill they are stopped at the final narrow pass to southern greece and they get their cloth-bearing asses slapped.

**TL;DR:** 

**The metaphor works since there's lots of ass slapping and the hodlers will lose to begin with but the sacrifice is worth it since we rise in the end and invade a while later :)**

What *does* matter, I feel, is that nefarious actors preying on the weak that think it's ok to lie and steal and cheat their way to the 'top' and gamble with the money of the vast majority of honest citizens in the world are no longer incentivised to do so in the brave new world we are all building here.

As for the crystal ball, Tom is at least basing his predictions on some fairly sound methodology (that follows the diffusion of innovations) and has actually been humble enough to say there are far too many variables to be certain of any of this (hence his revised prediction).

There's a few short-term hurdles to cross with G20 and the alt/ICO shakeout we're witnessing, which will see those who only got into this to make 'get rich quick' gains exiting, but long term fundamentals with the technology and infrastructure being built around it has never looked better.  

Similarly, the millions of ordinary people signing up and learning about all this in Q4 last year tells us we're about to ['cross the chasm'](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*KIXz2tAVqXVREkyd.png) once those last few hurdles are traversed.

If people see enough value in the technology, they will go out their way to learn new skills even if they find it difficult at first (no matter what the age).  

But, just as we couldn't foist PC's and computer mice on unsuspecting secretaries in the 80's and 90's and force them to start using wordperfect rather than their typewriters... so too must we have patience with that older generation who are not yet comfortable enough to be able to embrace crypto without potentially firing off their live savings into the nether-sphere.

That's not relevant to the discussion, considering how many ways there are to calculate that number, nor is it even that large.

854	_Untermensch	"""Responding to the concerns of members, the FSB has undertaken a review of the financial stability risks posed by the rapid growth of crypto-assets. The FSB’s initial assessment is that crypto-assets do not pose risks to global financial stability at this time. The market continues to evolve rapidly, however, and this initial assessment could change if crypto-assets were to become significantly more widely used or interconnected with the core of the regulated financial system. For example, wider use and greater interconnectedness could, if it occurred without material improvements in conduct, market integrity and cyber resilience, pose financial stability risks through confidence effects. *The FSB will identify metrics for enhanced monitoring of the financial stability risks posed by crypto-assets and update the G20 as appropriate*[emphasis added].

*Crypto-assets raise a host of issues around consumer and investor protection, as well as their use to shield illicit activity and for money laundering and terrorist financing*[emphasis added]. At the same time, the technologies underlying them have the potential to improve the efficiency and inclusiveness of both the financial system and the economy. Relevant national authorities have begun to address these issues. Given the global nature of these markets, *further international coordination is warranted* [emphasis added], supported by international organisations such as the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures, Financial Action Task Force and International Organization of Securities Commissions."""	1521439910.0	2018-03-18 21:46:49.845374	dvwu0qz	t3_85ed00	/r/Bitcoin/comments/85ed00/g20_hot_news/dvwu0qz/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1

&gt; LONDON - The global watchdog that drove through a welter of banking and market reforms after the financial crisis said it will pivot more toward reviewing existing rules and away from designing new ones.

&gt; Carney, who stands down next year when his term as governor of the Bank of England ends, signaled that whoever succeeds him would be overseeing a more open watchdog focused on reviewing rules instead of pushing through new standards.

&gt; The FSB membership will undertake a thorough review of whether the watchdog is &amp;quot;Fit for purpose&amp;quot; for evaluating and amending rules.

&gt; Its a long time since my last post and we are now in a bear market and many investors especially those who have entered into crypto only from Jan18 would have found their portfolio to be reduced significantly.

&gt; If time is to be spent on crypto then spend them on improving your programming knowledge, going through github codes, networking and interacting more with cyrpto folks.

When you started hodling is what matters. If you start holding when Bitcoin is worth 10 000 000 dollars per coin you are probably not going to get rich of Bitcoin.  And Bitcoin got value at first buy somebody willing to buy two pizza's with 10 000 BTC and then people willing to buy it to use it to buy drugs with. That's how the value took of, that was people NOT hodling at all. So if everybody hodles then it does not work.  So everybody that comes after me needs to hodl stronger than me so I can sleep at night ... and you can carry the burden.

No. Things don't have inherent value. This is apriori true. If Alice has a car and Bob has a computer and Alice trades her car for the computer of Bob, then to Alice the value of the computer is higher than that of the car and for Bob the value of the car is higher than that of the computer.

Value must be subjective, or else no trade would ever occur.

Also this is getting into semantics but think about a bottle of water. Does it have inherent value? Water is one of the most important substances on earth, but its' value changes drastically. Imagine how the residents of Flint, MI perceive the value of a bottle of water vs somebody who lives in Seattle. Does a pre-manufactured bottle of water (like Dasani) have more value than a home-bottled bottle of water through a filtered tap? No. It doesn't. So why is it so much more expensive and still such a successful product? Because inherent value is meaningless, market value is the only thing that matters in a trade-based economy (which is pretty much all economies)"	1521436764.0	2018-03-18 21:46:49.845374	dvwr1v6	t1_dvw6bpl	/r/Bitcoin/comments/8580h4/what_hodling_is_actually_like/dvwr1v6/	1	Bitcoin	t5_2s3qj	1
